-- QUICK FIX: Add service_role policy to suggestion_sections
-- Issue: Even service role key is blocked by RLS
-- Location: dashboard.js line 721 uses supabaseService but still gets RLS error
-- ============================================================================

-- The code comment says "Use service client to bypass RLS" but service role
-- ALSO needs a policy if RLS is enabled!

-- ============================================================================
-- Add service_role policy for ALL operations
-- ============================================================================
-- Drop first (safe - won't error if doesn't exist)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "service_role_all_suggestion_sections" ON suggestion_sections;

-- Create the policy
CREATE POLICY "service_role_all_suggestion_sections"
    ON suggestion_sections
    FOR ALL
    TO service_role
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- ============================================================================
-- Verify the policy was created
-- ============================================================================
