## üè¢ TEST ORGANIZATIONS

### Organization 1: Test Organization 1
**Purpose**: Primary organization for testing

**Creation Steps**:
```sql
-- Option 1: Via Setup Wizard

-- Follow wizard to create organization

-- Option 2: Manual SQL
INSERT INTO organizations (name, slug, organization_type, created_at)
VALUES (
  'Test Organization 1',
  'test-org-1',
  'nonprofit',
  NOW()
);

-- Get the organization ID
SELECT id FROM organizations WHERE slug = 'test-org-1';

-- Add Bob as owner
INSERT INTO user_organizations (user_id, organization_id, role, is_active)
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'bob@org1.com'),
  (SELECT id FROM organizations WHERE slug = 'test-org-1'),
  'owner',
  true
);

-- Add Charlie as member
INSERT INTO user_organizations (user_id, organization_id, role, is_active)
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'charlie@org1.com'),
  (SELECT id FROM organizations WHERE slug = 'test-org-1'),
  'member',
  true

```

---

### Organization 2: Test Organization 2
**Purpose**: Test global admin cross-organization access

INSERT INTO organizations (name, slug, organization_type, created_at)
VALUES (
  'Test Organization 2',
  'test-org-2',
  'nonprofit',
  NOW()
);
```

```sql
-- ============================================================================
-- TEST DATA SETUP SCRIPT
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
-- ============================================================================

-- 1. SET ALICE AS GLOBAL ADMIN
UPDATE users
SET is_global_admin = true
WHERE email = 'alice@test.com';

-- 2. CREATE TEST ORGANIZATIONS
INSERT INTO organizations (name, slug, organization_type, created_at)

  'owner',
  true
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM user_organizations
  WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'bob@org1.com')

);

-- 4. ADD CHARLIE AS MEMBER OF ORG 1
INSERT INTO user_organizations (user_id, organization_id, role, is_active)

SELECT
  u.email,
  u.is_global_admin,
  o.name as organization,

## üßπ CLEANUP (After Testing)

### Remove Test Data
```sql
-- 1. Delete user-organization assignments
DELETE FROM user_organizations
WHERE user_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM users
  WHERE email IN ('alice@test.com', 'bob@org1.com', 'charlie@org1.com')
);

-- 2. Delete test documents (if uploaded)
DELETE FROM document_sections
WHERE organization_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM organizations
  WHERE slug IN ('test-org-1', 'test-org-2')
