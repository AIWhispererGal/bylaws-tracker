In the `/tests` directory, you now have:

1. **QUICK_START_TEST.md** - 15-minute smoke test
2. **LOCAL_TEST_PLAN.md** - Complete testing guide (2-3 hours)
3. **VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md** - Track your testing progress
4. **TEST_RESULTS_TEMPLATE.md** - Document your findings
5. **ROLLBACK_PROCEDURES.md** - If something goes wrong
6. **README.md** - Overview of all documents
