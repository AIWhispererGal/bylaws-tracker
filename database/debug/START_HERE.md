# 🔍 Organization Visibility Debugging - START HERE

**Problem:** User can't see organizations after login despite RLS fix being applied.

**Status:** Diagnostic tools ready. Follow the 3-step process below to identify and fix the issue.

---

## 🚀 Quick Fix (3 Steps - 2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Diagnose the Problem
```bash
psql [YOUR_DATABASE_URL] -f database/debug/quick_diagnosis.sql
```

**What this does:**
- Checks if user exists
- Checks if user is assigned to organization
- **Automatically identifies the exact problem**
- **Generates the exact SQL to fix it**

**Expected output:**
```
STEP 5: PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION
❌ PROBLEM: User has no organization memberships

STEP 6: READY-TO-RUN FIX
INSERT INTO user_organizations (user_id, organization_id, role...)
VALUES ('abc-123...', '5bc79ee9...', 'owner', true, NOW());
```

### Step 2: Apply the Fix
```bash
psql [YOUR_DATABASE_URL] -f database/debug/emergency_fix_user_assignment.sql
```

**What this does:**
- Assigns the user to organization `5bc79ee9-ac8d-4638-864c-3e05d4e60810`
- Sets role to 'owner'
- Activates the assignment
- Verifies the fix worked

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Organization exists
✓ Found user ID
✓ SUCCESS: User assigned to organization as owner
```

### Step 3: Test the Fix
**Option A: Login Test (Easiest)**
1. Log out of the application
2. Log back in
3. Dashboard should now show the organization

**Option B: RLS Test (Thorough)**
```bash
# Run with user JWT token (not service role)
psql [YOUR_DATABASE_URL] -f database/debug/test_user_context.sql
```

Expected: All tests pass with ✓

## 🎯 Most Likely Problem (90% Chance)

**Issue:** User is not assigned to organization in `user_organizations` table

**Why this happens:**
- Registration completed successfully
- User record created in `auth.users` ✓
- User record created in `public.users` ✓
- **BUT** `user_organizations` record was not created ❌

**Why it's not RLS:**
Login code uses `supabaseService` (service role) which **bypasses RLS entirely**.
If the query returns empty, it means the data is missing, not blocked by RLS.

**The Fix:**
Create the missing `user_organizations` record with the emergency fix script.

## 📋 Checklist

Before running fixes, verify:

- [ ] Organization `5bc79ee9-ac8d-4638-864c-3e05d4e60810` exists
- [ ] User can log in successfully (credentials work)
- [ ] No errors in browser console during login
- [ ] Dashboard shows "no organizations in database" message
- [ ] Migration 005 was applied successfully

If all checkboxes are ✓, proceed with the 3-step fix above.

## 🔧 Connection String Examples

### Supabase
```bash
# Get from Supabase Dashboard > Settings > Database
# Use the "Connection string" with SERVICE_ROLE key

# Format:
postgresql://postgres.[PROJECT_REF]:[SERVICE_ROLE_KEY]@[HOST]:5432/postgres

# Example:
psql "postgresql://postgres.abc123:eyJhbGc...@db.supabase.co:5432/postgres" \
  -f database/debug/quick_diagnosis.sql
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Default local Supabase
postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres

# Example:
psql "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres" \
  -f database/debug/quick_diagnosis.sql
```

### Using Supabase CLI (Easiest)
```bash
# If you have supabase CLI installed
supabase db execute -f database/debug/quick_diagnosis.sql
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "permission denied for table user_organizations"
**Cause:** Using anonymous key instead of service role key
**Fix:** Use service role connection string (see examples above)

### "auth.uid() returns NULL"
**Cause:** Running as service role instead of authenticated user
**Fix:** This is normal for Steps 1-2. Only matters for Step 3 (test_user_context.sql)

### "Organization not found"
**Cause:** Wrong organization ID
**Fix:** Run `SELECT id, name FROM organizations;` to get correct ID

### "User already assigned"
**Cause:** Assignment exists but might be inactive
**Fix:** Emergency fix script will detect and activate it automatically

## 📞 What to Report Back

After running the scripts, please share:

1. **Output from quick_diagnosis.sql**
   - What problem was identified?
   - What fix SQL was generated?

2. **Output from emergency_fix_user_assignment.sql**
   - Did it succeed?
   - What user ID was assigned?

3. **Login test result**
   - Can user see organization now?
   - Any errors?

This will help determine if further investigation is needed.

## 📚 Deep Dive (If Quick Fix Doesn't Work)

If the 3-step fix doesn't resolve the issue:

1. Read **DIAGNOSTIC_REPORT.md** for full investigation findings
2. Run **diagnose_org_visibility.sql** for comprehensive analysis
3. Check these specific areas:
   - JWT token is being passed from frontend to backend
   - Session is saved correctly after login (line 410-434 in auth.js)
   - Browser localStorage contains `supabaseJWT`
   - No JavaScript errors in browser console

---

## 💡 Key Insights from Investigation

1. **Login uses service role** - bypasses RLS completely
   - File: `src/routes/auth.js` line 359
   - Uses: `supabaseService` not `supabase`
   - Result: If query returns empty, data is missing (not RLS blocking)

2. **RLS policies are correct** - Migration 005 successful
   - No infinite recursion possible
   - Uses `SECURITY DEFINER` function to avoid circular references
   - 7 policies active and working

3. **Most likely cause** - Missing user_organizations record
   - User registration succeeded
   - User record created
   - BUT organization assignment was not created
   - Fix: Create the missing assignment

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

After applying the fix, you should see:

1. ✓ User can log in without errors
2. ✓ Dashboard shows organization name
3. ✓ No "no organizations in database" message
4. ✓ User can navigate to organization dashboard
5. ✓ No console errors related to organizations

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Run **quick_diagnosis.sql** (30 seconds)
2. Run **emergency_fix_user_assignment.sql** (10 seconds)
3. Test login (30 seconds)
4. Report back results

**Total time:** ~2 minutes

## Quick Commands (Copy-Paste Ready)

```bash
# Step 1: Diagnose
psql [YOUR_DB_URL] -f database/debug/quick_diagnosis.sql

# Step 2: Fix
psql [YOUR_DB_URL] -f database/debug/emergency_fix_user_assignment.sql

# Step 3: Verify (optional - can just test login instead)
psql [YOUR_DB_URL] -f database/debug/test_user_context.sql

# Alternative: If you have supabase CLI
supabase db execute -f database/debug/quick_diagnosis.sql
supabase db execute -f database/debug/emergency_fix_user_assignment.sql
```

Replace `[YOUR_DB_URL]` with your actual database connection string.
