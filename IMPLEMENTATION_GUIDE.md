# üìò BYLAWS AMENDMENT TRACKER - IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED IMPROVEMENTS

### Phase 1: Voting System Placeholder Fix ‚úÖ
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Time:** 10 minutes
**Impact:** Immediate user experience improvement

**What was fixed:**
- Deleted deprecated `views/bylaws.ejs` file that contained hardcoded dummy suggestions
- Verified `views/bylaws-improved.ejs` correctly fetches real data from database
- Confirmed `server.js` line 56 renders correct view

**Result:** Users now see only real suggestions from the database, no dummy data.

---

### Phase 2: Smart Semantic Parser ‚úÖ
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Time:** 4 hours
**Impact:** Foundation for all future improvements

**What was created:**
- New `google-apps-script/SmartSemanticParser.gs` parser
- Intelligently detects hierarchical bylaw structure
- Offers three granularity levels:
  1. **Section Level** (RECOMMENDED) - ~30-50 chunks
  2. **Subsection Level** (Granular) - ~100-150 chunks
  3. **All Items** (Ultra-Granular) - ~200-300 chunks

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Proper legal citations: "Article V, Section 6(A)(1)"
- ‚úÖ Hierarchical structure detection
- ‚úÖ User choice of parsing granularity
- ‚úÖ Preview before committing
- ‚úÖ Edge case handling (orphaned lists, no letters, etc.)

## üöÄ HOW TO USE THE NEW PARSER

### Step 1: Copy Script to Google Apps Script

1. Open your Google Doc with the bylaws
2. Go to **Extensions ‚Üí Apps Script**
3. Create a new script file called `SmartSemanticParser.gs`
4. Copy the contents from `/google-apps-script/SmartSemanticParser.gs`
5. **IMPORTANT:** Update line 17 with your NGROK URL:
   ```javascript
   const APP_URL = 'https://YOUR-NGROK-URL.ngrok-free.app';
   ```
6. Save the script (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
7. Reload your Google Doc

### Step 2: Choose Your Parsing Level

You'll see a new menu: **üîß Bylaws Sync - Smart Parser**

**Option 1: Section Level (RECOMMENDED)**
- Click "üì§ Parse: Section Level (RECOMMENDED)"
- Creates ~30-50 sections (one per "Section X: Title")
- **Best for:** Balanced granularity, typical use case
- **Example sections:**
  - Article V, Section 1
  - Article V, Section 2
  - Article V, Section 6

**Option 2: Subsection Level (Granular)**
- Click "üì§ Parse: Subsection Level (Granular)"
- Creates ~100-150 sections (breaks at lettered items A., B., C.)
- **Best for:** When you need more targeted amendments
- **Example sections:**
  - Article V, Section 1(A)
  - Article V, Section 1(B)
  - Article V, Section 6(A)
  - Article V, Section 6(B)

**Option 3: All Items (Ultra-Granular)**
- Click "üì§ Parse: All Items (Ultra-Granular)"
- Creates ~200-300 sections (every numbered/lettered item)
- **Best for:** Maximum flexibility, complex amendment workflows
- **Example sections:**
  - Article V, Section 6(A)(1)
  - Article V, Section 6(A)(2)
  - Article V, Section 9(8)(a)
  - Article V, Section 9(8)(b)

### Step 3: Preview First (Optional but Recommended)

Before parsing, click "üîç Preview Parsing Results" to see:
- How many sections will be created
- Sample citations
- First 15 section previews

This helps you choose the right granularity level.

### Step 4: Parse the Document

1. Choose your parsing level
2. Confirm the number of sections
3. Wait for "‚úÖ Success!" message
4. Open the web app to see your sections

## üìä COMPARISON: OLD vs NEW PARSER

| Feature | Old Parser (BetterParser.gs) | New Parser (SmartSemanticParser.gs) |
|---------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Citations** | "Article III, Section 1, Paragraph 1.1" (uncitable) | "Article V, Section 6(A)(1)" (legally valid) |
| **Granularity** | Fixed (paragraph-based, 150-char chunks) | User choice (3 levels) |
| **Structure Detection** | Basic (ARTICLE, Section headers only) | Advanced (A., B., 1., 2., a., b., i., ii.) |
| **Semantic Awareness** | Character count (arbitrary) | Hierarchical structure (intelligent) |
| **Preview** | Limited (first 10 sections) | Full (shows all citations) |
| **Edge Cases** | Fails on nested lists | Handles orphaned lists gracefully |
| **Section Count** | ~100-200 (varies wildly) | Predictable (30-50 / 100-150 / 200-300) |

## üéØ RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW

### For Initial Setup:

1. **Start with Section Level** (RECOMMENDED)
   - Click "Preview" first
   - Should show ~30-50 sections
   - Parse and test in web app

2. **If sections are too large:**
   - Delete all sections in database (via web app "Initialize Doc" button)
   - Re-parse with "Subsection Level"
   - Verify in web app

3. **If sections are too small:**
   - You're probably fine at Section Level
   - Remember: Multi-section selection (Phase 3) will allow combining sections

### For Re-Parsing:

**IMPORTANT:** Re-parsing will **upsert** existing sections:
- Same citation ‚Üí Updates text
- New citation ‚Üí Creates new section
- Deleted citation ‚Üí Remains in database (manual cleanup needed)

**Best Practice:**
1. Export committee decisions first (JSON backup)
2. Re-parse with same granularity
3. Verify sections in web app
4. Re-import decisions if needed

---

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### "No sections found"
**Cause:** Document doesn't have recognizable structure
**Fix:** Ensure your bylaws use standard format:
- `ARTICLE [Roman Numeral]` for articles
- `Section [Number]:` for sections
- `A.` or `(a)` for subsections

### "Connection Error"
**Cause:** NGROK URL incorrect or server not running
**Fix:**
1. Check NGROK is running: `ngrok http 3000`
2. Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`)
3. Update line 17 in SmartSemanticParser.gs
4. Save and retry

### "Too many sections created"
**Cause:** Chose "All Items" for a large document
**Fix:** Re-parse with "Section Level" instead

### "Citations are wrong"
**Cause:** Document uses non-standard numbering
**Fix:** Post an example of the problematic section structure - we can adjust the regex patterns

## üìà WHAT'S NEXT: PHASE 3 (Future Enhancement)

**Multi-Section Selection** - Not yet implemented

**What it will do:**
- Select multiple sections at once (Shift+click range, Ctrl+click individual)
- Apply same amendment to multiple sections
- Lock/unlock sections in bulk
- Constraint: Must be within same article

**Why not now:**
- Parser must be stable first (Phase 2)
- Database migration required (junction table)
- 8-12 hours implementation time

**When to implement:**
- After 2-3 weeks of using new parser
- After committee confirms section granularity is correct
- After gathering feedback on workflow

## üìû SUPPORT & QUESTIONS

### Common Questions:

**Q: Which parsing level should I use?**
A: Start with "Section Level (RECOMMENDED)" - it gives ~30-50 sections, which is manageable and meaningful.

**Q: Can I re-parse if I choose the wrong level?**
A: Yes! Just click "Initialize Doc" in the web app to clear sections, then re-parse. Export decisions first as backup.

**Q: Will this work with other municipalities' bylaws?**
A: Yes, if they follow standard structure (ARTICLE [Roman], Section [Number], A./B./C., 1./2./3.). Minor adjustments may be needed for unique formats.

**Q: What about Table of Contents?**
A: The parser skips Table of Contents automatically (no text under headers = no section created).

**Q: Can I amend multiple sections at once?**
A: Not yet - that's Phase 3 (Multi-Section Selection). For now, amend one section at a time.

   - Document edge cases we didn't anticipate

3. **Report back:**
   - How many sections were created?
   - Are the citations correct?
   - Is the granularity right for your needs?
   - Any features you'd like adjusted?

4. **Consider Phase 3:**
   - After 2-3 weeks of usage
