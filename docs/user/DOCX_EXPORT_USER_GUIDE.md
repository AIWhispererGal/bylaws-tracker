## Understanding the Document

### Document Structure

Your exported Word document contains:

1. **Title Page**
   - Document name
   - Export date and time
   - Your name (who exported it)

2. **Summary Statistics**
   - Total number of changed sections
   - Average changes per section
   - Legend explaining the formatting

3. **Changed Sections**
   - Each section with its number and title
   - Changes shown with special formatting (see below)

4. **Footer**
   - Export date
   - Generated by Bylaws Amendment Tool

### Reading Track Changes

The document uses Track Changes-style formatting to show what changed:

#### Deleted Text (Original)
- **Appearance:** <span style="color: red; text-decoration: line-through;">Red text with strikethrough</span>
- **Meaning:** This text was in the original bylaws but has been removed

**Example:**
> The board shall meet <span style="color: red; text-decoration: line-through;">monthly</span> quarterly.

#### Added Text (New)
- **Appearance:** <span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">Blue text with underline</span>
- **Meaning:** This text is new and has been added to the bylaws

**Example:**
> The board shall meet <span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">quarterly</span>.

#### Unchanged Text (Context)
- **Appearance:** Normal black text
- **Meaning:** This text hasn't changed (shown for context)

**Complete Example:**
> Section 3.2 - Board Meetings
>
> The board shall meet <span style="color: red; text-decoration: line-through;">monthly</span> <span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">quarterly</span> to review and approve amendments to the bylaws.

**Translation:** The meeting frequency changed from "monthly" to "quarterly".
