## ✋ Known Limitations (Non-Blocking)

1. **Debounce Window**: 10-second window may feel long
   - Impact: LOW (prevents duplicates effectively)
   - Future: Consider reducing to 5 seconds

2. **Large File Parsing**: Files >100 sections take 1-2s
   - Impact: LOW (still within 5s target)
   - Future: Add progress indicator

3. **Sidebar Whitespace**: Removing 2 items creates empty space
   - Impact: COSMETIC (functionality unaffected)
   - Future: Add "Coming Soon" badges
