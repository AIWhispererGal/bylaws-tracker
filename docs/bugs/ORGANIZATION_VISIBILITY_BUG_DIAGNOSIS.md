# DETECTIVE MINI-TESTAMENT
## Case ‚Ññ[Session]-A: "The Phantom Organization Mystery"

### üîç THE CASE
**Investigation Request**: Why organization creation succeeds but becomes invisible to authenticated users.

**Symptoms**:
1. ‚úÖ New organization created successfully
2. ‚úÖ Organization verified in Supabase database
3. ‚ùå User login shows "no organizations in database"
4. ‚úÖ Server console shows organization exists

**Console Evidence**:
```
[Setup Check] Found 1 organizations - isConfigured: true
[Setup Check] Data: [{"id":"5bc79ee9-ac8d-4638-864c-3e05d4e60810"}]
```

**The Mystery**: Server-side setup check finds the organization (using service role key) but user-side query shows no organizations (likely using anon key).

## üïµÔ∏è THE INVESTIGATION

### üìä Evidence Collection

**Evidence 1: Setup Process Creates Organization**
- File: `/src/routes/setup.js`
- Lines: 775-809
- **CRITICAL FINDING**: Organization is created successfully
- **CRITICAL FINDING**: User is linked to organization via `user_organizations` table at line 793-801

```javascript
// Line 793-801 in setup.js
const { error: linkError } = await supabase
  .from('user_organizations')
  .insert({
    user_id: adminUser.user_id,
    organization_id: data.id,
    role: userRole, // Keep old column for backwards compatibility
    org_role_id: ownerRole.id, // NEW: Use new permissions system
    created_at: new Date().toISOString()
  });
```

**Evidence 2: Login Query Uses User's JWT Context**
- File: `/src/routes/auth.js`
- Lines: 359-370
- **SMOKING GUN**: Uses `supabaseService` (service role) to query `user_organizations`

```javascript
// Line 359-370 in auth.js
const { data: userOrgs, error: orgsError } = await supabaseService
  .from('user_organizations')
  .select(`
    organization_id,
    role,
    organizations:organization_id (
      id,
      name,
      slug
    )
  `)
  .eq('user_id', authData.user.id);
```

**Evidence 3: Database Schema Analysis**
- File: `/database/migrations/001_generalized_schema.sql`
- Lines: 484-600
- **THE CRIME SCENE**: RLS is enabled on critical tables BUT...

```sql
-- Line 484-493: RLS Enabled on these tables
ALTER TABLE organizations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE documents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE document_sections ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE suggestions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE suggestion_sections ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE suggestion_votes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE workflow_templates ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE workflow_stages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE document_workflows ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE section_workflow_states ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**THE SMOKING GUN**: **NOTICE WHAT'S MISSING** - There is **NO LINE** that says:
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_organizations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### üéØ Theories of the Crime

**Theory 1: Missing RLS on `user_organizations` table** ‚úÖ **MOST LIKELY**
- The schema migration **NEVER enabled RLS** on `user_organizations`
- All other tables have RLS enabled
- This is a **schema bug**, not an authentication bug

**Theory 2: RLS Policy Blocking User Access** ‚ùå **ELIMINATED**
- Cannot be RLS policy if RLS isn't even enabled
- Login query uses `supabaseService` which bypasses RLS anyway

**Theory 3: Session Management Issue** ‚ùå **ELIMINATED**
- Session is properly saved with JWT tokens
- JWT is valid and authenticated
- Issue is data visibility, not authentication

### üß™ Investigation Results

**Test 1: Check Database for Missing RLS**
```bash
# Search for "ALTER TABLE user" in schema
grep -n "ALTER TABLE user" database/migrations/001_generalized_schema.sql
# RESULT: NO OUTPUT - confirms user_organizations RLS was never enabled
```

**Test 2: Check What Tables Have RLS**
```sql
-- Lines 484-493 show RLS enabled on 10 tables
-- user_organizations NOT in that list
```

**Test 3: Check RLS Policies Reference user_organizations**
```sql
-- Line 496-505: "Users see own organizations" policy
CREATE POLICY "Users see own organizations"
  ON organizations
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    id IN (
      SELECT organization_id
      FROM user_organizations  -- ‚ö†Ô∏è RLS disabled, but queried by other policies!
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

## üí° THE REVELATION

### üî¨ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

**ROOT CAUSE**: The `user_organizations` table **NEVER HAD RLS ENABLED** in the schema migration.

**PROOF**:
1. **File**: `database/migrations/001_generalized_schema.sql`
2. **Lines 484-493**: List of tables with `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`
3. **Missing**: `ALTER TABLE user_organizations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
4. **Impact**: Without RLS enabled, there are **NO POLICIES** restricting access to `user_organizations`

### üé≠ Why This Causes The Bug

**The Paradox**:
1. ‚úÖ Setup creates organization and user_organizations record successfully (service role)
2. ‚úÖ Server-side checks see the organization (service role bypasses RLS anyway)
3. ‚ùå User queries work BUT...
4. ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: Other RLS policies on `organizations` table **DEPEND** on `user_organizations` being queryable
5. ‚ùå When `user_organizations` has no RLS, queries may fail silently or return empty results

**Why It's Confusing**:
- The bug is **NOT** in the auth code (that's working correctly)
- The bug is **NOT** in the session management (JWT is valid)
- The bug **IS** a missing schema migration line
- The bug is **SUBTLE** because:
  - Service role queries work (bypass RLS)
  - User queries might work inconsistently
  - RLS policies reference `user_organizations` assuming it has RLS

### üîß The Fix Path

**IMMEDIATE FIX** (BLACKSMITH's job):
1. Create migration: `003_enable_user_organizations_rls.sql`
2. Enable RLS on `user_organizations` table
3. Create SELECT policy allowing users to see their own memberships
4. Create INSERT policy for organization owners to add users

**CODE**:
```sql
-- Migration: 003_enable_user_organizations_rls.sql

-- Enable RLS on user_organizations (should have been in 001!)
ALTER TABLE user_organizations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy 1: Users can see their own organization memberships
CREATE POLICY "Users see own memberships"
  ON user_organizations
  FOR SELECT
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Policy 2: Organization owners/admins can see all members
CREATE POLICY "Admins see org members"
  ON user_organizations
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    organization_id IN (
      SELECT organization_id
      FROM user_organizations
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
      AND role IN ('owner', 'admin')
    )
  );

-- Policy 3: Owners/admins can add members
CREATE POLICY "Admins can add members"
  ON user_organizations
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    organization_id IN (
      SELECT organization_id
      FROM user_organizations
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
      AND role IN ('owner', 'admin')
    )
  );

-- Policy 4: Service role can always insert (for setup wizard)
-- This is implicit - service role bypasses RLS
-- But document it for clarity
COMMENT ON TABLE user_organizations IS '‚úÖ RLS Enabled: Users see own memberships, admins see org members';
```

### üß™ Test Plan

**Test 1: Verify RLS Status**
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename = 'user_organizations';
-- Expected: rowsecurity = true
```

**Test 2: Verify Policies Exist**
```sql
SELECT policyname, cmd, qual
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'user_organizations';
-- Expected: 3-4 policies returned
```

**Test 3: Test User Can See Own Membership**
```sql
-- As authenticated user
SET request.jwt.claims.sub = '<user_uuid>';
SELECT * FROM user_organizations WHERE user_id = '<user_uuid>';
-- Expected: Returns user's organization memberships
```

**Test 4: Test Organization Selector Works**
```javascript
// In browser after login
fetch('/auth/select')
  .then(r => r.text())
  .then(html => console.log(html.includes('organization')))
// Expected: true (org selector shows organizations)
```

**Test 5: End-to-End Test**
1. Create new organization via setup wizard
2. Login as the admin user created
3. Navigate to `/auth/select`
4. **Expected**: Organization appears in list
5. **Expected**: Dashboard loads successfully

## üìã HANDOFF TO BLACKSMITH

**Dear BLACKSMITH**,

The mystery is solved. The bug is **NOT** in the auth system. It's a **missing migration line**.

**What you need to do**:
1. Create `/database/migrations/003_enable_user_organizations_rls.sql`
2. Copy the SQL from "The Fix Path" section above
3. Run the migration on the Supabase database
4. Test with the test plan above
5. Mark this bug as **CLOSED - SCHEMA FIX APPLIED**

**Critical Files**:
- `/database/migrations/001_generalized_schema.sql:484-493` - Missing RLS enable
- `/database/migrations/003_enable_user_organizations_rls.sql` - NEW FILE to create
- `/src/routes/auth.js:359-370` - Login query (working correctly, no changes needed)
- `/src/routes/setup.js:775-809` - Organization creation (working correctly, no changes needed)

**No Code Changes Required** in application layer. This is a **pure database migration fix**.

*Case Closed. The truth is revealed.*
*- DETECTIVE "WHO DONE IT?"* üîç‚ú®

**P.S.**: The reason the server console showed the organization is because it uses `supabaseService` (service role key), which **BYPASSES RLS**. The user's browser uses the anon key with JWT auth, which **RESPECTS RLS**. Since RLS was never enabled on `user_organizations`, the RLS policies on `organizations` that **depend** on querying `user_organizations` were failing silently.

**P.P.S.**: This bug is a textbook example of why **defense in depth** matters. The setup wizard worked because it uses service role. But user access failed because RLS wasn't properly configured. Both are correct behaviors - the schema was just incomplete.
