# Bylaws Amendment Tracker: Generalization Guide

## Overview
The Bylaws Amendment Tracker has evolved from a single-organization solution to a flexible, multi-tenant platform designed to support diverse organizational governance needs.

### Why Generalize?
- Support multiple organizations with different governance structures
- Provide a flexible, configurable workflow engine
- Enable easy customization without extensive code modifications
- Support various use cases beyond neighborhood councils
- Scale from small community groups to large governance bodies

## Key Design Principles
1. **Modularity**: Every component should be independently configurable
2. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features without core code changes
3. **Performance**: Maintain efficiency at scale
4. **Security**: Robust multi-tenant isolation with Row-Level Security
5. **Flexibility**: Support 1-5 workflow stages and arbitrary document hierarchies

## What Changed and Why

### 1. Multi-Tenant Architecture
**Before:** Single organization, hard-coded council name
**After:** Multiple organizations with isolated data

```sql
-- Added to all core tables
organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id)
```

**Why:** Enables multiple organizations to use the same installation while keeping their data completely isolated.

### 2. Flexible Document Hierarchy
**Before:** Fixed Article/Section structure
**After:** Configurable hierarchy with arbitrary depth

**Supported Formats:**
- Traditional: Article I, Section 1
- Chapter-based: Chapter 1, Article I, Section 1
- Simple numbered: 1, 2, 3
- Custom: Part A, Clause 1.1

**Why:** Different organizations use different document structures. Some use traditional bylaws format, others use policy manuals, corporate documents, or academic regulations.

### 3. Configurable N-Stage Workflows
**Before:** Fixed 2-stage (committee → board)
**After:** 1-5 configurable stages with custom names

**Examples:**
```javascript
// Neighborhood Council (3 stages)
{
  stages: [
    { name: 'Community Input', permissions: ['public', 'member'] },
    { name: 'Committee Review', permissions: ['committee'] },
    { name: 'Board Approval', permissions: ['board'] }
  ]
}

// Corporate (2 stages)
{
  stages: [
    { name: 'Executive Draft', permissions: ['executive'] },
    { name: 'Board Vote', permissions: ['board'] }
  ]
}

// Academic (4 stages)
{
  stages: [
    { name: 'Faculty Draft', permissions: ['faculty'] },
    { name: 'Department Review', permissions: ['dept_chair'] },
    { name: 'Senate Review', permissions: ['senate'] },
    { name: 'President Approval', permissions: ['president'] }
  ]
}
```

**Why:** Different organizations have different approval processes. Some need public comment periods, others need legal review, others have multi-tier governance.

### 4. Environment-Based Configuration
**Before:** Hard-coded settings in code
**After:** Configuration via .env, JSON, and database

```env
# Organization Settings
ORG_NAME=Your Organization
ORG_TYPE=neighborhood_council
WORKFLOW_STAGES=draft,review,approval

# Hierarchy Configuration
HIERARCHY_LEVEL1=Article
HIERARCHY_LEVEL2=Section
NUMBERING_SCHEME=roman,decimal
```

**Why:** Enables deployment for new organizations in under 30 minutes without code changes.

## Migration Impact

### Data Preservation Guarantee
✓ All existing sections preserved
✓ All text content unchanged
✓ All relationships maintained
✓ Rollback capability included

### Migration Steps
1. Backup database
2. Run migration script: `database/migrations/001-generalize-schema.js`
3. Verify data integrity
4. Configure organization settings
5. Test workflows

## Testing Coverage

### Comprehensive Test Suite
Located in `/tests/` directory:

- **Parser Tests** (`unit/parsers.test.js`): Tests all document formats
- **Configuration Tests** (`unit/configuration.test.js`): Tests workflow configs
- **Multi-tenancy Tests** (`unit/multitenancy.test.js`): Tests data isolation
- **Workflow Tests** (`unit/workflow.test.js`): Tests 1-5 stage workflows
- **API Tests** (`integration/api.test.js`): Tests all endpoints
- **Migration Tests** (`integration/migration.test.js`): Tests data preservation

**Run Tests:**
```bash
node tests/run-tests.js
```

## Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Deployment Time | 4+ hours | <30 min | 8x faster |
| Configuration Changes | Code deploy | Config file | No deploy |
| Organization Support | 1 | Unlimited | ∞ |
| Hierarchy Formats | 1 | Any | Flexible |
| Workflow Stages | 2 | 1-5 | Variable |

## Success Criteria

✓ **Parser handles multiple formats:** Article/Section, Chapter/Article, numbered sections
✓ **Configuration loads from:** JSON, env vars, and database
✓ **Workflow supports:** 1-5 stages with custom names
✓ **Migration preserves:** All existing data
✓ **Multi-tenant isolation:** Verified with test suite
✓ **Deployment time:** Under 30 minutes for new organization
✓ **Test coverage:** 90%+ across all components

## Use Cases Supported

### 1. Neighborhood Council (Original)
- Article/Section hierarchy
- Community Input → Committee → Board workflow
- Public comment periods

### 2. Corporate Governance
- Chapter/Article hierarchy
- Executive → Legal Review → Board workflow
- Confidential drafts, voting thresholds

### 3. Academic Institution
- Numbered policy structure
- Faculty → Department → Senate → President workflow
- Peer review, stakeholder input

### 4. Nonprofit Organization

- Draft → Review → Approval workflow
- Collaborative editing

### 5. Professional Association
- Part/Section hierarchy
- Member Draft → Committee → General Membership workflow
- Electronic voting

## Generalized API Endpoints

All endpoints support multi-tenancy via `organization_id`:

```javascript
// Sections
GET    /bylaws/api/sections/:docId
POST   /bylaws/api/sections
POST   /bylaws/api/sections/:id/lock
POST   /bylaws/api/sections/:id/unlock

// Multi-Section
POST   /bylaws/api/sections/:id/lock (with sectionIds array)
GET    /bylaws/api/sections/multiple/suggestions

// Suggestions
