# Quick Test Guide - MVP Workflow Features

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Testing

### Prerequisites
1. âœ… Server running on http://localhost:3000
2. âœ… Database migration 021 applied
3. âœ… User logged in with admin/owner role
4. âœ… At least one document with workflow assigned

## Test 1: Multi-Org Session Storage (2 minutes)

### Steps:
1. **Navigate to**: http://localhost:3000/auth/select
2. **Select**: Any organization from the list
3. **Navigate away**: Go to /dashboard

âœ… Previously selected org is highlighted
âœ… Page scrolls to that organization
```

### Browser Console Check:
```javascript
// Open DevTools (F12), check localStorage:
localStorage.getItem('lastOrgId')     // Should show UUID
localStorage.getItem('lastOrgName')   // Should show org name
localStorage.getItem('lastOrgTimestamp') // Should show ISO timestamp
```

   - Suggestions applied
8. **Verify**: Redirect to /dashboard after 2 seconds

### Expected Result:
```
âœ… Button only enabled at 100% approved
âœ… Prompt appears for optional notes
âœ… Loading state during creation
âœ… Success notification with version details
âœ… Auto-redirect to dashboard
âœ… New version visible in document history
```

### API Response (check Network tab):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Document progressed successfully to version 1.2",
  "version": {
    "id": "uuid-here",
    "version_number": "1.2"
  },
  "stats": {
    "sectionsProcessed": 15,
    "suggestionsApplied": 8,
    "fromStage": "Initial Review"
  }
}
```

### Verify in Database:
```sql
-- Check new version was created
SELECT version_number, created_at, applied_suggestions
FROM document_versions
WHERE document_id = 'your-doc-id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Check suggestions marked as implemented
SELECT id, status, implemented_at, implemented_in_version
FROM suggestions
WHERE document_id = 'your-doc-id'
  AND status = 'implemented';
```

## Test 5: Edge Cases (5 minutes)

### Test A: Progress with Unapproved Sections
1. **Setup**: Document with some unapproved sections
2. **Click**: "Progress to Next Stage"
3. **Expected**: Button is disabled
4. **Verify**: Tooltip says "X section(s) pending approval"

### Test B: Approve Unmodified with Zero
1. **Setup**: Document where all sections have suggestions
2. **Verify**: "Approve All Unmodified" button disabled
3. **Verify**: Button shows "(0 sections)"

### Test C: Document with No Workflow
1. **Navigate to**: Document without workflow assigned
2. **Expected**: Graceful error or no workflow UI
3. **Verify**: No crashes

### Test D: Refresh After Changes
1. **Approve**: Some sections
2. **Click**: "Refresh Progress"
3. **Verify**: UI updates without page reload
4. **Verify**: Counts are accurate

### Test E: localStorage Across Sessions
1. **Select**: Organization A
2. **Close**: Browser completely
3. **Reopen**: Browser and navigate to /auth/select
4. **Verify**: Organization A still shows "Last Used"

## Quick Validation Commands

### Check localStorage (Browser Console):
```javascript
// View all stored values
Object.keys(localStorage).filter(k => k.startsWith('last')).forEach(k => {
  console.log(k, ':', localStorage.getItem(k));
});
```

### Check API Endpoints (Curl):
```bash
# Get progress status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/workflow/documents/{DOC_ID}/progress-status \
  -H "Cookie: connect.sid=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE"

# Approve unmodified
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/workflow/documents/{DOC_ID}/approve-unmodified \
  -H "Cookie: connect.sid=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Progress workflow
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/workflow/documents/{DOC_ID}/progress \
  -H "Cookie: connect.sid=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"notes": "Test progression"}'
```

### Check Browser Network Tab:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Perform actions
4. Look for these requests:
   - `GET /api/workflow/documents/{id}/progress-status`
   - `POST /api/workflow/documents/{id}/approve-unmodified`
   - `POST /api/workflow/documents/{id}/progress`

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "Progress button stays disabled"
**Cause**: Not all sections approved
**Fix**:
1. Click "Refresh Progress"
2. Check progress percentage
3. Approve remaining sections manually or use "Approve All Unmodified"

### Issue 2: "localStorage not working"
**Cause**: Browser privacy settings or incognito mode
**Fix**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Disable private browsing
3. Clear site data and retry

### Issue 3: "Approve unmodified shows 0 but sections exist"
**Cause**: All sections have suggestions
**Fix**:
1. Check if sections actually have suggestions in database
2. Verify suggestion_sections junction table
3. This is expected behavior

### Issue 4: "Version creation fails"
**Cause**: Database migration not applied or RLS issue
**Fix**:
1. Verify migration 021 is applied
2. Check server logs for detailed error
3. Verify user has admin/owner role
4. Check `create_document_version` function exists

### Issue 5: "Progress bar not updating"
**Cause**: JavaScript error or API failure
**Fix**:
1. Open browser console
2. Look for JavaScript errors
3. Check Network tab for failed API calls
4. Click "Refresh Progress" manually
