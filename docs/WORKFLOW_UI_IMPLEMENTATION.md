**UI:**
```html
<div class="workflow-progress">
  <h5>Workflow Progress</h5>
  <div class="progress">
    <div class="progress-bar bg-success" id="workflow-progress-bar">
      X / Y sections approved
    </div>
  </div>
  <small>Current Stage: [Stage Name]</small>
</div>
```

### 2. Section Workflow Status Badges

**Location:** `/views/dashboard/document-viewer.ejs` (lines 250-255)

**Features:**
- Color-coded status badge for each section:
  - **Green (success)**: Approved
  - **Yellow (warning)**: Pending
  - **Red (danger)**: Rejected

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Viewing Document
1. User navigates to document viewer
2. Workflow progress bar loads at top showing overall status
3. Each section shows workflow badge with current state
4. Sections load workflow states in parallel on page load

### 2. Approving Section (Admin/Owner Only)
1. User expands section
2. Approval actions panel appears (if user has permission)
3. User clicks "Approve" button
4. Prompt appears for optional approval notes
5. Section badge updates to "Approved" (green)
6. Progress bar increments
7. Success toast notification appears

### 3. Rejecting Section (Admin/Owner Only)
1. User expands section
2. User clicks "Reject" button
3. Prompt requires rejection reason
4. Section badge updates to "Rejected" (red)
5. Section can be re-submitted by members
6. Success toast notification appears

### 4. Locking Section (Admin/Owner Only)
1. Section must be approved first
2. User must select a suggestion (future feature)
3. User clicks "Lock Section" button
4. Optional lock notes prompt
5. Section becomes immutable
6. Locked badge (blue) appears
7. No further edits/approvals allowed

### 5. Viewing Approval History
1. User clicks history icon on section badge
2. Modal opens with approval timeline
3. Timeline shows:
   - All approval/rejection/lock actions
   - Who performed each action
   - When action occurred
   - Approval notes (if provided)
4. User closes modal

- Cannot see: Approval action buttons

### Member Role
- Can see: Everything viewers see + suggestion forms
- Cannot see: Approval action buttons

### Admin Role
- Can see: Everything + approval action buttons
- Can do: Approve, reject, lock sections (subject to workflow stage permissions)

### Owner Role
- Can see: Everything admins see
- Can do: Everything admins can do + advance workflow stages

   - Query `workflow_stages` table for permissions
   - Join with `user_organizations` for role validation
   - Update workflow state on approval/rejection

4. **Add Audit Logging**
   - Log all approval actions to `section_workflow_states`
   - Store `actioned_by`, `actioned_at`, `approval_metadata`
   - Track full approval history for compliance

5. **Test with Real Data**
   - Seed workflow templates and stages
   - Assign workflows to documents
   - Initialize section workflow states
   - Test approval flow end-to-end

## Coordination Notes

The MCP coordination hooks failed due to SQLite binding issues in WSL (known issue with claude-flow). However, implementation patterns can be shared manually:

**UI Patterns:**
- Dynamic badge rendering based on workflow state
- Permission-based button visibility
- Real-time status updates via fetch API
- Toast notification system for user feedback
- Bootstrap modal for detailed views

**Backend Patterns Needed:**
- Permission validation middleware
- Workflow state queries
- Audit trail logging
- Progress calculation aggregation

---

## Success Criteria Met

- ✅ Workflow progress bar implemented
- ✅ Section workflow status badges implemented
- ✅ Approval action panel implemented
- ✅ Permission-based button visibility implemented
- ✅ Approval history modal implemented
- ✅ Toast notifications implemented
- ✅ CSS styling for all components implemented
- ✅ JavaScript action handlers implemented
- ✅ Dashboard route enhanced with permissions

**Ready for backend API integration!**

---

**Implementation Complete:** Frontend workflow UI is production-ready pending backend API endpoints.

**Next Phase:** Backend developer implements workflow API routes and permission checks.
