## Critical Issues Found (Pre-Testing)

### ‚úÖ ISSUE #1: Missing `/admin/organization` Route (FIXED)
**Severity:** HIGH - Page Not Found Error
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Route has been added

**Location:**
- File: `/src/routes/admin.js` (lines 139-160)
- View: `/views/admin/organization-settings.ejs`

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// Added to src/routes/admin.js
router.get('/organization', requireAdmin, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { supabaseService } = req;

    // Get all organizations for selection
    const { data: organizations, error } = await supabaseService
      .from('organizations')
      .select('*')
      .order('name', { ascending: true });

    if (error) throw error;

    res.render('admin/organization-settings', {
      title: 'Organization Settings',
      organizations: organizations || [],
      currentOrgId: req.session.organizationId || null
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Organization settings page error:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Error loading organization settings page');
  }
});
```

**Verification Needed:**
- ‚è≥ Test route loads successfully (HTTP 200)

## Developer Notes

### Critical Findings

1. **Missing Route:** The `/admin/organization` route does not exist. This needs to be added before deployment.

2. **Suggestion Loading:** The client-side code uses `/bylaws/api/sections/{sectionId}/suggestions` which SHOULD filter by section_id. Need to verify server-side query includes proper WHERE clause.

3. **Diff View Implementation:** The diff view uses the `diff` library and appears correctly implemented with proper CSS classes. Need manual testing to verify visual rendering.

4. **Multi-Section Support:** The code shows comprehensive multi-section support with junction tables and validation. Need to verify this works end-to-end.

### Recommendations

1. **Fix ISSUE #1 IMMEDIATELY** - Add the missing route handler
2. **Add Automated Tests** - Convert manual tests to Jest/Playwright tests
3. **Add API Tests** - Test all `/bylaws/api/*` endpoints with various inputs
4. **Add Database Tests** - Verify RLS policies and constraints work correctly
5. **Performance Testing** - Test with 100+ sections and 1000+ suggestions

---

## Conclusion

**URGENT:** The missing `/admin/organization` route is a **SHOWSTOPPER** that will cause 404 errors in production. This must be fixed before deployment.

All other features appear well-implemented based on code review, but require manual testing to confirm user-facing functionality works correctly. The suggestion filtering, diff view, and multi-section features have comprehensive implementations that should work, but need validation.

**Next Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Fix missing route (URGENT)
2. ‚è≥ Run manual test suite (this document)
3. ‚è≥ Document results with screenshots
4. ‚è≥ Create bug tickets for any failures
5. ‚è≥ Re-test after fixes
6. ‚úÖ APPROVE for deployment only after all tests pass
