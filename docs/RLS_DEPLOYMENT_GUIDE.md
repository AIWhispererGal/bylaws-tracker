# RLS Deployment Guide - Multi-Tenant Security for 99 LA Neighborhood Councils

## üéØ What This Guide Accomplishes

This guide will enable **proper Row Level Security (RLS)** for your bylaws amendment tracking system, ensuring complete data isolation between **all 99 Los Angeles neighborhood councils** during bylaws year.

---

## ‚úÖ Changes Already Applied

The following code changes have been completed and are ready to use:

### 1. **Server.js Updated** ‚úÖ
- Created two Supabase clients:
  - `supabase` - Anon client for regular operations (RLS enabled)
  - `supabaseService` - Service role client for setup wizard (bypasses RLS)
- Updated setup status check to use service client

### 2. **Setup Routes Updated** ‚úÖ
- Changed `processSetupData()` to use `req.supabaseService` instead of `req.supabase`
- Setup wizard will now bypass RLS during organization creation

### 3. **Environment Template Updated** ‚úÖ
- Added `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` placeholder to `.env`

### 4. **Fixed Migration Created** ‚úÖ
- `/database/migrations/005_implement_proper_rls_FIXED.sql` is ready to deploy
- Removes problematic `deleted_at` column reference
- Implements layer-based security model with NO recursion

## üìã Required Actions (YOU MUST DO THESE)

### **Step 1: Get Your Supabase Service Role Key** üîë

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://app.supabase.com/
2. Select your project: **amendment-tracker** (auuzurghrjokbqzivfca)
3. Click on **Settings** (gear icon) in the left sidebar
4. Click on **API** under Project Settings
5. Scroll down to **Project API keys**
6. Find the **service_role** key (it starts with `eyJhbGc...`)
7. Click **Copy** to copy it to your clipboard

‚ö†Ô∏è **SECURITY WARNING**: The service role key has **complete database access**. Never commit it to Git or share it publicly!

### **Step 2: Add Service Role Key to .env** üìù

1. Open your `.env` file in the project root
2. Find the line that says:
   ```
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_HERE
   ```
3. Replace `YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_HERE` with the key you copied
4. Save the file

**Example:**
```bash
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImF1dXp1cmdocmpva2Jxeml2ZmNhIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1OTg3ODI1OCwiZXhwIjoyMDc1NDU0MjU4fQ...
```

### **Step 3: Run the RLS Migration** üóÑÔ∏è

1. Go to Supabase dashboard: https://app.supabase.com/
2. Select your project: **amendment-tracker**
3. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
4. Click **New query**
5. Open the migration file:
   ```
   /database/migrations/005_implement_proper_rls_FIXED.sql
   ```
6. Copy **ALL contents** of the file
7. Paste into the SQL Editor
8. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl+Enter)

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ RLS PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED!
========================================
Changes made:
  ‚úÖ Dropped all existing policies
  ‚úÖ Enabled RLS on 12 tables
  ‚úÖ Created 48 policies (layer-based model)
  ‚úÖ Created performance indexes
  ‚úÖ Service role bypass enabled
  ‚úÖ Verification function created
  üîß FIX APPLIED: Removed reference to deleted_at column

‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL: Add SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to .env
The setup wizard REQUIRES service role key to bypass RLS

‚úÖ SECURITY MODEL:
  ‚úÖ Layer 1 (user_organizations): Direct auth.uid() check
  ‚úÖ Layer 2+ (organizations, documents, etc.): Reference Layer 1
  ‚úÖ NO RECURSION - infinite loop fixed!
  ‚úÖ Service role can bypass for setup operations

üéâ 99-COUNCIL ISOLATION ENABLED!
Each neighborhood council will have completely isolated data.
========================================
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **If you see ANY errors**: Stop and report them immediately. Do NOT proceed.

### **Step 4: Restart Your Server** üîÑ

The code changes require a server restart to load the new environment variable.

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C if running)
# Then restart it:
node server.js
```

**Expected startup output:**
```
Bylaws Amendment Tracker running on https://3eed1324c595.ngrok-free.app

Current Configuration:
- App URL: https://3eed1324c595.ngrok-free.app
- Supabase: Connected
```

## üß™ Testing & Verification

### **Test 1: Setup Wizard Should Work** ‚úÖ

1. Clear your browser cookies (to reset session)
2. Go to: `https://3eed1324c595.ngrok-free.app/setup`
3. Complete the setup wizard:
   - Organization Name: **Test Council 1**
   - Organization Type: **Neighborhood Council**
   - Complete all steps through document import

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ No RLS errors
- ‚úÖ Organization created successfully
- ‚úÖ Document imported successfully

### **Test 2: Multi-Tenant Isolation** üîí

**Create a second organization:**

1. **IMPORTANT**: You need to manually clear the session first
   - Option A: Use a different browser (e.g., if you used Chrome, now use Firefox)
   - Option B: Clear cookies for your ngrok URL
   - Option C: Use incognito/private window

2. Go to setup wizard again: `https://3eed1324c595.ngrok-free.app/setup`
3. Create a second organization:
   - Organization Name: **Test Council 2**
   - Complete setup

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Second organization created successfully
- ‚úÖ No access to Test Council 1's data

**Verify Isolation:**

Run this SQL query in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check that both organizations exist
SELECT id, name, slug FROM organizations;

-- Check that documents are properly isolated
SELECT
  d.id,
  d.title,
  o.name as organization_name
FROM documents d
JOIN organizations o ON d.organization_id = o.id;
```

You should see:
- 2 organizations
- Documents linked to their respective organizations
- NO shared data between councils

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Service role key is undefined"
**Cause**: Server started before .env was updated
**Fix**:
1. Add service role key to .env
2. Restart server with `node server.js`

### Issue: "Row violates row-level security policy"
**Cause**: Migration not run, or using anon key instead of service key
**Fix**:
1. Verify migration ran successfully in Supabase
2. Check that `.env` has `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
3. Restart server
4. Clear browser cookies and try again

### Issue: "Infinite recursion detected"
**Cause**: Old RLS policies still active
**Fix**:
1. Run this in SQL Editor to drop ALL policies:
   ```sql
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users_see_own_memberships" ON user_organizations;
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users see own memberships" ON user_organizations;
   -- (Add any other policy names that appear in error)
   ```
2. Re-run the FIXED migration
3. Restart server

### Issue: "Column deleted_at does not exist"
**Cause**: Running old migration instead of FIXED version
**Fix**: Use `/database/migrations/005_implement_proper_rls_FIXED.sql`

## üéâ Success Criteria

You'll know everything is working correctly when:

1. ‚úÖ Setup wizard completes without RLS errors
2. ‚úÖ Can create multiple organizations (99 councils ready!)
3. ‚úÖ Each organization sees only its own data
4. ‚úÖ No infinite recursion errors
5. ‚úÖ SQL verification query shows proper isolation

---

## üîê Security Architecture Summary

### **Layer-Based Model (NO RECURSION)**

**Layer 1**: `user_organizations`
- Uses **direct** `auth.uid()` comparison
- NO subqueries = NO recursion
- Foundation for all other layers

**Layer 2**: `organizations`
- References Layer 1 via subquery
- Inherits user access from memberships

**Layer 3**: `documents`, `workflow_templates`
- Filters by `organization_id`
- References Layer 2 (organizations)

**Layer 4**: `document_sections`, `suggestions`, etc.
- Filters by parent document's organization
- Inherits isolation from Layer 3

### **Service Role Bypass**
- Setup wizard uses `supabaseService` client
- Bypasses RLS with service_role key
- Creates organizations, then adds user membership
- After setup: regular operations use RLS-enabled `supabase` client

## üìû Next Steps

After completing this guide:

1. ‚úÖ Test with 2-3 test organizations
2. ‚úÖ Verify complete data isolation
3. ‚úÖ Run `/database/tests/rls_isolation_test.sql` for comprehensive testing
4. ‚úÖ Document any council-specific configuration needs
5. ‚úÖ Prepare for rollout to all 99 LA neighborhood councils
