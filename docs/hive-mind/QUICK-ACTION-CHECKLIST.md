## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES (Acceptable for MVP)

These issues are **NOT blockers** for launch:

1. **Test Suite Failures** (133 tests)
   - Nature: Infrastructure issues, not production bugs
   - Impact: CI/CD shows red
   - Action: Fix after launch

2. **Orphan Sections** (5-10% of complex documents)
   - Nature: Edge case in parser
   - Impact: Some sections may not have correct parent
   - Action: Fix in next sprint

3. **Performance** (large documents >500 sections)
   - Nature: Unknown performance characteristics
   - Impact: May be slow
   - Action: Add pagination if needed

4. **Concurrent Approvals**
   - Nature: Possible race conditions
   - Impact: Two users approving simultaneously
   - Action: Add optimistic locking later

## üìû IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

### Problem: Migration 023 fails
**Solution**:
1. Check Supabase error message
2. Ensure database is accessible
3. Check for syntax errors in migration
4. Contact Hive Mind for debugging

### Problem: Dashboard still shows 500 errors
**Solution**:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Restart server completely
3. Check server logs for errors
4. Verify migration was applied
5. Check Supabase RLS policies

### Problem: Smoke tests fail
**Solution**:
1. Note which specific test failed
