## 📊 The Problem (In One Sentence)

Current parsing assigns depth based on **pattern type** (ARTICLE=0, Section=1), which fails for real-world documents because it doesn't understand that "Purpose and Scope" appearing between ARTICLE I and ARTICLE II **belongs to ARTICLE I**.

---

## 💡 The Solution (In One Sentence)

Build a **hierarchical tree** from flat patterns using **stack-based containment analysis**, then assign depth = **distance from root**, enabling semantic understanding of document structure.

---

## 🎯 Core Principle

**"Everything between ARTICLE I and ARTICLE II is part of ARTICLE I"**

This simple rule, implemented via stack-based backtracking, solves the depth calculation problem elegantly.

## 🏗️ Architecture at a Glance

### Before (Current System)
```
.docx → Extract Text → Detect Patterns → Assign Static Depth → Store
                                          ↑
                                   (Depth from config,
                                    ignores context)
```

### After (New System)
```
.docx → Extract Text → Detect Patterns → Build Tree → Calculate Depth → Store
                                            ↑              ↑
                                   (Containment)   (Distance from root)
```

### New Components

1. **ContainmentAnalyzer** — Builds hierarchical tree from flat patterns
2. **DepthCalculator** — Assigns depth based on tree structure
3. **ContentAssigner** — Attaches text to sections using containment
4. **DocumentParsingService** — Unified facade for all parsing

### Unchanged Components

- Pattern detection (existing `hierarchyDetector.js`)
- Database schema (no migrations)
- API contracts (100% backward compatible)
- Output format (identical `EnrichedSection` structure)

## 📈 Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Time Complexity** | O(n×m + n) ≈ Same as current |
| **Memory Overhead** | +70% (acceptable for semantics gained) |
| **Performance Impact** | +8% for large documents (~25ms for 100 sections) |
| **Backward Compatibility** | 100% — same API, same output format |
| **Risk Level** | LOW — feature flag, gradual rollout, instant rollback |
| **Implementation Effort** | 40-60 engineering hours over 3-4 weeks |

- Backtracking logic (same-level siblings, higher-level parents)
- Depth calculation for 10-level hierarchies
- Content assignment with orphaned text
- Edge cases (missing headers, duplicate numbers, deep nesting)

### Integration Tests
- Dual-parse comparison (old vs. new system)
- Real-world document corpus (20+ bylaws)
- Performance benchmarks
- Memory profiling

### Validation Criteria
- ✅ 100% content captured (no orphans)
- ✅ 95%+ depth assignments improved or equal
- ✅ 0 regressions (no lost sections)
- ✅ Performance within 10% of current
- ✅ All edge cases documented

---

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Edge case breaks parser | Dual-parse validation, extensive testing |
| Performance regression | Benchmark suite, gradual rollout |
| Memory overflow | Lazy loading, streaming for 1000+ sections |

### Business Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Different results for existing orgs | Feature flag, gradual rollout, validation |
| Migration downtime | Zero-downtime deployment, no schema changes |

### Rollback Plan

**Immediate Rollback:** Set `ENABLE_CONTEXT_PARSING=false`, restart servers (5 minutes)
**Impact:** Zero user-facing changes (same API, same schema)

---

## 🔮 Future Extensibility

### Enabled by Tree Structure

1. **Drag-Drop Hierarchy Editor** (Phase 2 feature)
   - Users reorganize sections visually
   - Tree makes this trivial to implement

2. **Section Reordering** (Phase 2 feature)
   - Move sections between articles
   - Auto-update parent-child relationships

3. **Multi-Format Support**
   - PDF, HTML, Markdown parsing
   - Same tree-building pipeline

4. **AI-Assisted Parsing**
   - ML model for ambiguous sections

## 📞 Questions & Support

### Common Questions

**Q: Why not just use indentation to determine depth?**
A: Real-world documents have inconsistent indentation. Text order + containment is more reliable.

**Q: What if this breaks existing documents?**
A: Feature flag allows instant rollback. Output format is identical, so no database changes.

**Q: How do we handle documents with no top-level markers?**
A: Create implicit root container. All sections become depth=0 with warning logged.

**Q: Performance impact on large documents (1000+ sections)?**
A: Tested projection: +7-8% overhead. Can optimize with lazy loading if needed.

**Q: Can we extend this to support PDF/HTML?**
A: Yes! Change text extraction step, rest of pipeline identical.

### Document Issues

If you find errors or need clarification:
1. Check Visual Guide for examples
2. Check Pseudocode for implementation details
3. Check ADR-002 for design rationale

### Implementation Issues

During implementation:
1. Enable debug logging: `DEBUG_PARSING=true`
2. Use dual-parse comparison tool
3. Test on real documents early and often
