## 🔧 Technical Changes

- ❌ "Documents" link (documents table visible on dashboard)
- ❌ "Suggestions" (placeholder - moved to future reports)
- ❌ "Approvals" (placeholder - moved to future analytics)
- ❌ "Workflows" (admin feature - consolidated)

**Added/Renamed Items:**
- ✅ "Organization Settings" (clearer than "Organization")
- ✅ "Users" (shorter than "Manage Members")
- ✅ "Reports" (Coming Soon - future feature)
- ✅ "Analytics" (Coming Soon - future feature)
- ✅ "Help" (new support link)

**Role-Based Visibility:**
```javascript
Management section visible only to:
- GLOBAL_ADMIN
- ORG_OWNER
- ORG_ADMIN
```

### 2. **Topbar Dropdown Cleanup**
**File**: `/views/dashboard/dashboard.ejs` (lines 517-522)

**Removed:**
- ❌ "Manage Users" duplicate link

**Result:**

- No duplicate navigation items

### 3. **Enhanced CSS Styles**
**File**: `/views/dashboard/dashboard.ejs` (lines 63-98)

```css
.nav-link.disabled {
  opacity: 0.5;
  cursor: not-allowed;
}

.nav-link.disabled:hover {
  background-color: transparent;
  border-left-color: transparent;
}

.nav-link:hover:not(.disabled) {
  /* Only active links get hover effect */
}
```
