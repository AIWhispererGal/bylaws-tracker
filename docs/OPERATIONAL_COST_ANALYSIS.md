# Operational Cost Analysis: Self-Deploy vs SaaS

**Analysis Date:** October 7, 2025
**Analyst:** DevOps Cost Assessment Agent
**Session:** Hive Mind Consensus Review

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis compares the total cost of ownership (TCO) for two deployment models over a 5-year horizon, considering infrastructure, support, and development costs across growth scenarios.

**Key Findings:**
- **Self-Deploy Model:** Lower initial costs, but exponential complexity scaling
- **SaaS Model:** Higher upfront investment, but predictable scaling and margins
- **Break-Even Point:** SaaS becomes more cost-efficient at ~150 organizations
- **Recommended Model:** **SaaS** for long-term sustainability and profitability

## 1. Infrastructure Cost Analysis

### 1.1 Self-Deploy Model

**Your Infrastructure (Provider-Side):**
| Component | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Documentation Site | $20 | $240 | Static hosting (Netlify/Vercel) |
| Support Domain | $2 | $24 | .com domain |
| Status Page | $29 | $348 | StatusPage.io or similar |
| GitHub Organization | $0 | $0 | Public repos free |
| CI/CD (GitHub Actions) | $0-50 | $0-600 | Depends on private repos |
| Email Service (Support) | $15 | $180 | SendGrid/Postmark basic |
| **Subtotal** | **$66-116** | **$792-1,392** | Fixed costs |

**Customer Infrastructure (Per Organization):**
| Component | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Supabase Free Tier | $0 | $0 | Up to 500MB database, 2GB bandwidth |
| Supabase Pro (if needed) | $25 | $300 | For orgs with >50 documents |
| Hosting (Node.js) | $5-15 | $60-180 | DigitalOcean/Heroku basic |
| Custom Domain | $12/year | $12 | Optional |
| **Per-Org Cost** | **$5-40** | **$60-492** | Varies by size |

**Cost Distribution Problem:**
- Customers bear 90%+ of infrastructure costs
- Cost opacity: customers don't know true TCO until deployed
- Variable pricing creates uncertainty
- Support costs spike when customers hit free tier limits

**Scaling Issues:**
- Each customer deployment is a unique snowflake
- Debugging requires access to customer infrastructure
- No centralized monitoring or alerting
- Database migrations require customer coordination

### 1.2 SaaS Model

**Infrastructure Costs (Centralized):**

#### Database & Storage (Supabase)
| Tier | Organizations | Database Size | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|------|--------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Pro | 1-50 | 5GB | $25 | $300 |
| Pro + Storage | 51-150 | 15GB | $25 + $25 | $600 |
| Team | 151-500 | 50GB | $599 | $7,188 |
| Team + Scale | 501-1,000 | 100GB | $599 + $200 | $9,588 |
| Enterprise | 1,000+ | Custom | $2,000+ | $24,000+ |

**Calculation Assumptions:**
- Average organization: 50 documents × 200 sections × 2KB = ~20MB
- 50 orgs: 1GB database + overhead = 5GB total
- 250 orgs: 5GB + indexes/history = 15GB total
- 1,000 orgs: 20GB + full audit logs = 100GB total

#### Additional SaaS Infrastructure
| Component | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 5 | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Application Hosting | $20 | $100 | $400 | DigitalOcean App Platform (scales) |
| CDN (Static Assets) | $10 | $20 | $50 | CloudFlare Pro |
| Email Service | $15 | $50 | $200 | Transactional emails (SendGrid) |
| Monitoring & APM | $25 | $100 | $300 | Datadog/New Relic |
| Backup & DR | $20 | $50 | $150 | Automated backups, point-in-time recovery |
| Redis Cache | $15 | $30 | $100 | Session management, rate limiting |
| SSL Certificates | $0 | $0 | $0 | Let's Encrypt |
| **Infrastructure Subtotal** | **$130** | **$950** | **$1,200** | Excludes Supabase |

**Total Monthly Infrastructure:**
| Year | Organizations | Supabase | Other Services | Total/Month | Total/Year |
|------|--------------|----------|----------------|-------------|------------|
| Year 1 | 50 | $25 | $130 | $155 | $1,860 |
| Year 2 | 250 | $50 | $350 | $400 | $4,800 |
| Year 5 | 1,000 | $799 | $1,200 | $1,999 | $23,988 |

## 5. Break-Even Analysis

### 5.1 Pricing Strategy Requirements

**Self-Deploy Model:**
To cover costs, must charge:
- Year 1: $2,496/org/year = **$208/org/month**
- Year 5: $1,038/org/year = **$87/org/month**
- Problem: **No direct revenue** unless charging for software licenses

**Possible Revenue Models:**
1. **Open Source + Support:** $0 software, $100/month support contract
2. **Freemium:** Free tier, $50/month premium features
3. **One-Time License:** $500/org (must sell 250 licenses/year to break even in Year 1)

**SaaS Model:**
To cover costs, must charge:
- Year 1: $1,753/org/year = **$146/org/month**
- Year 5: $309/org/year = **$26/org/month**

**Recommended SaaS Pricing Tiers:**

| Tier | Monthly Price | Target Customers | Margin @ 1,000 Orgs |
|------|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Starter** | $29/org | Small orgs (<25 documents) | +$3/org profit |
| **Professional** | $79/org | Medium orgs (25-100 docs) | +$53/org profit |
| **Enterprise** | $199/org | Large orgs (100+ docs) | +$173/org profit |

**Mixed Pricing Scenario (Year 5, 1,000 orgs):**
- 600 orgs × $29 = $17,400/month
- 300 orgs × $79 = $23,700/month
- 100 orgs × $199 = $19,900/month
- **Total Revenue:** $61,000/month = $732,000/year
- **Total Costs:** $308,988/year
- **Net Profit:** $423,012/year (58% margin)

### 5.2 Break-Even Points

**Self-Deploy Model:**
- **Never breaks even** without monetization strategy
- If charging $100/month support: Breaks even at ~104 customers (Year 1)
- **Problem:** Most customers will self-support to avoid fees

**SaaS Model:**
| Pricing Tier | Break-Even Point | Months to Profitability |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| $29/month | 300 orgs | Month 18-24 |
| $79/month | 110 orgs | Month 6-12 |
| $199/month | 44 orgs | Month 3-6 |
| **Mixed (60/30/10)** | **145 orgs** | **Month 9-12** |

**Profitability Timeline (SaaS):**
- **Month 6:** First profit with aggressive $79/month pricing
- **Month 12:** Sustainable profit with mixed pricing
- **Year 2:** Profitable at any reasonable pricing tier
- **Year 5:** 50-60% profit margins
