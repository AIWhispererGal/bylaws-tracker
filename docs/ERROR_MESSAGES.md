# Error Messages & User Guidance

## Overview

This document catalogs all user-facing error messages in the onboarding flow, providing consistent, helpful, and actionable guidance.

## Principles for Error Messages

1. **Be Human:** Use conversational, empathetic language
2. **Be Specific:** Tell users exactly what went wrong
3. **Be Actionable:** Always provide clear next steps
4. **Be Positive:** Frame as opportunities to improve, not failures

**Template:**
```
[Icon] [What happened]

[Why it happened - optional if obvious]

[What to do about it]:
‚Ä¢ Action 1
‚Ä¢ Action 2
‚Ä¢ Action 3

[Button: Primary Action] [Button: Alternative Action]
```

We strongly recommend:

This makes it hard to determine the hierarchy.

Examples found:
‚Ä¢ Article I

‚Ä¢ Section A (expected: Section 1)

Recommendation:
‚Ä¢ Use consistent numbering throughout
‚Ä¢ Articles: Roman (I, II, III)

This is normal if:
‚úì These "Articles" only contain subsections
‚úì The actual content is in the subsections
‚úì They serve as organizational containers

Example:
Article III - Membership (no direct content)
  Section 3.1 - Eligibility (has content)
  Section 3.2 - Dues (has content)
