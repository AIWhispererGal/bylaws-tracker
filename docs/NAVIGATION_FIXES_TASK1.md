## Migration Notes

### Deprecated Routes
- `/bylaws` - Old document viewer (still exists but removed from navigation)
- Tab-based routing (`?tab=suggestions`, `?tab=approvals`) - Disabled pending implementation

### Future Enhancements
When Suggestions and Approvals views are implemented:
1. Remove `onclick="return false;"` from links
2. Update `href` to actual routes (e.g., `/dashboard/suggestions`)
3. Remove "Soon" badges
4. Update tooltips or remove them

---

## Console Verification

No console errors should appear when:
- Clicking any navigation link
- Hovering over disabled workflow links
- Switching between user roles
- Navigating between pages

---

## Accessibility

- All links have proper `href` attributes (no empty hrefs)
- Disabled links use `onclick="return false;"` instead of `href="#"`
- Tooltips provide context for disabled features
- Icons have descriptive labels
- Role-based visibility is properly implemented

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ All navigation links are functional or properly disabled
2. 🔲 Implement Suggestions view (`/dashboard/suggestions`)
3. 🔲 Implement Approvals view (`/dashboard/approvals`)
4. 🔲 Consider migrating away from `/bylaws` route entirely
5. 🔲 Add breadcrumb navigation for deeper pages

---

## Summary

**Task 1 Complete!** All navigation issues have been resolved:

✅ Documents link routes to correct page
✅ Global Admin sees "Manage Members"
✅ Workflow links are properly disabled with user feedback
✅ Admin Workflows link added
✅ Consistent navigation across all user roles
✅ No broken links or console errors

**Impact:** Improved user experience with clear, functional navigation that respects role-based access control.
