## 🚨 Known Issues & Mitigation

### Issue 1: Render Free Tier Spin-Down
**Problem:** Free tier apps spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity
**Impact:** First request after spin-down takes 30-60 seconds
**Mitigation:**
- Use Render Starter plan ($7/month) for always-on
- Or implement health check ping every 10 minutes
- Or use external uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot)

### Issue 2: Ephemeral File System
**Problem:** Render uses ephemeral disk, files deleted on restart
**Impact:** Uploaded documents lost on redeploy
**Mitigation:**
- Documents parsed immediately, not stored long-term
- Use Supabase Storage for persistent file storage (future)
- Current approach: Temporary storage for setup wizard only

### Issue 3: Environment Variable Updates
**Problem:** Changing env vars triggers full redeploy
**Impact:** 5-10 minute downtime during deploy
**Mitigation:**
- Plan env var changes during low-traffic periods
- Use feature flags for configuration changes
- Consider Redis or database for dynamic configuration

### Issue 4: Database Connection Limits
**Problem:** Supabase free tier has connection limits (60 connections)
**Impact:** Connection pool exhaustion under load
**Mitigation:**
- Configure connection pooling (max 10 connections)
- Use Supabase connection pooler (Supavisor)
- Monitor connection count in dashboard

### Issue 5: CORS and CSRF in Production
**Problem:** CORS/CSRF configuration may differ from local
**Impact:** API requests may fail from different origins
**Mitigation:**
- Verify CORS settings include Render URL
- Test CSRF token generation in production
- Add Render URL to trusted origins
