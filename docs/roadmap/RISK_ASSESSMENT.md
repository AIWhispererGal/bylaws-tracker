   - Rate limit AI features (10 requests/day/user)
   - Tiered access (free tier limited, paid unlimited)
   - Cost-based routing (use cheap model first)
   - Monitor per-user usage (identify abuse)

3. **Model Selection:**

   - Upgrade to larger models only if needed
   - Use quantized models (int8, reduced precision)
   - Explore open-source alternatives (Llama, Mistral)

4. **Infrastructure:**
   - Serverless GPU for burst workloads
   - Spot instances for training (80% cost reduction)
   - CPU inference where possible (no GPU)
   - Monitor GPU utilization (avoid waste)

5. **Financial Planning:**
   - Set AI budget per month ($500 limit)
   - Alert when 80% budget spent
   - Auto-disable AI if budget exhausted

#### RISK-403: Multi-Tenant Optimization Doesn't Scale
**Category:** Technical + Performance
**Impact:** 5 (Critical) - System unusable at scale
**Probability:** 3 (Possible) - Scaling is challenging
**Risk Score:** 15 🟠 HIGH

**Description:**
Optimization efforts fail to achieve scalability targets, system still can't handle 1000+ concurrent organizations.

**Indicators:**
- Response time > 500ms at 500+ orgs
- Database queries timeout
- Server resources maxed out
- Frequent crashes or restarts

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **Architecture Review:**
   - Evaluate microservices migration
   - Consider database sharding (by org_id)
   - Implement read replicas (analytics)
   - Use message queue for async work

2. **Database Optimization:**
   - Index optimization (analyze query plans)
   - Partitioning (by organization)
   - Connection pooling (PgBouncer)
   - Query caching (Redis)

3. **Application Optimization:**
   - Code profiling (identify bottlenecks)
   - N+1 query elimination
   - Lazy loading (defer non-critical)
   - Async processing (workers)

4. **Infrastructure Scaling:**
   - Horizontal scaling (multiple instances)
   - Load balancing (round-robin, least-conn)
   - CDN for static assets (Cloudflare)
   - Auto-scaling rules (CPU > 70%)

5. **Monitoring & Capacity:**
   - Real-time performance dashboard
   - Capacity planning (growth projections)
   - Load testing (simulate 2000+ orgs)
   - Regular performance reviews

#### RISK-404: API Security Vulnerabilities
**Category:** Security + Compliance
**Impact:** 5 (Critical) - Data breach, legal issues
**Probability:** 2 (Unlikely) - With proper security
**Risk Score:** 10 🟠 HIGH

**Description:**
API design introduces security vulnerabilities (authentication bypass, injection, IDOR, etc.), exposing user data.

**Indicators:**
- Security scan findings (critical/high)
- Unauthorized access in logs
- Data leak reported
- Penetration test failures

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **Security by Design:**
   - OAuth 2.0 / JWT authentication
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Input validation on all endpoints
   - Output encoding (prevent XSS)

2. **Common Vulnerabilities:**
   - SQL injection: Use parameterized queries
   - XSS: Sanitize all input, encode output
   - CSRF: Token validation on state-changing ops
   - IDOR: Verify user owns resource

3. **API Security Best Practices:**
   - Rate limiting (prevent brute force)
   - HTTPS only (no HTTP)
   - CORS configuration (whitelist origins)
   - API versioning (graceful deprecation)

4. **Security Testing:**
   - Automated scans (Snyk, OWASP ZAP)
   - Manual penetration testing (quarterly)
   - Code review by security expert
   - Bug bounty program (if budget allows)

5. **Incident Response:**
   - Security incident playbook
   - Breach notification procedures
   - API key rotation mechanism
   - Emergency API shutdown capability

**Owner:** Backend Developer + Security Engineer
**Review Date:** Monthly during Phase 4

#### RISK-405: Integration Complexity Overwhelms Users
**Category:** UX + Adoption
**Impact:** 3 (Medium) - Low adoption, support tickets
**Probability:** 4 (Likely) - Integrations can be complex
**Risk Score:** 12 🟠 HIGH

**Description:**
Third-party integrations (Zapier, Slack, etc.) are too complex to set up, leading to low adoption and high support burden.

**Indicators:**
- Integration setup abandonment > 50%
- Support tickets about integration config
- Low integration usage (< 20% of users)
- Negative feedback on complexity

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **Simplified Onboarding:**
   - One-click authentication (OAuth)
   - Pre-configured templates (common use cases)
   - Step-by-step wizard (not just docs)
   - Default settings that "just work"

2. **Documentation:**
   - Video tutorials (< 3 minutes each)
   - Screenshots for each step
   - Common troubleshooting (FAQ)
   - Example workflows (copy-paste)

3. **Developer Experience:**
   - SDKs in popular languages (JS, Python)
   - Interactive API playground (try before integrate)
   - Postman collection (import and run)
   - Code examples for all endpoints

4. **Support:**
   - Dedicated integration support channel
   - Community forum (users help users)
   - Office hours (live help sessions)
   - Integration health monitoring (notify if broken)

5. **Monitoring:**
   - Track integration setup funnel
   - Identify drop-off points
   - A/B test onboarding flows
   - Iterate based on data

## 📊 Overall Risk Profile

### Risk Summary by Phase

| Phase | Timeline | Avg Risk Score | Risk Level | Key Risks |
|-------|----------|----------------|------------|-----------|
| **Phase 1** | Week 1 | 6.6/25 | 🟡 LOW-MEDIUM | Supabase connection, Env vars |
| **Phase 2** | Weeks 2-3 | 10.4/25 | 🟠 MEDIUM | UI breaks, Feature creep |
| **Phase 3** | Month 2 | 13.4/25 | 🟠 MEDIUM-HIGH | PDF parsing, Migration |
| **Phase 4** | Months 3-4 | 14.6/25 | 🔴 HIGH | AI accuracy, Costs, Scaling |

### Risk Trend Analysis

**Observation:** Risk increases over time as features become more complex and innovative.

**Implications:**
1. Early phases should over-deliver to build buffer
2. Allocate more resources to later phases
3. Consider phase 4 features as "experimental" (can be descoped)
4. Build in contingency time (20% buffer for phases 3-4)

### Critical Risks (Score 17+)

| Risk ID | Description | Score | Phase | Decision Required |
|---------|-------------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| RISK-301 | PDF parsing accuracy | 20 | 3 | Go/No-Go by Nov 5 |
| RISK-401 | AI model accuracy | 20 | 4 | Go/No-Go by Nov 15 |

**Recommendation:**
- Both critical risks have clear go/no-go decision points
- If accuracy targets not met, pivot to simpler approaches
- Consider these features "bonus" not "required"
- Core product works without PDF or AI features
