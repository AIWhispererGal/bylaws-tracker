## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After reviewing **80+ documentation files** and analyzing the prior swarm's work, here's what I found:

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED WORK (October 23-27, 2025)
- **6 critical bugs FIXED** (section operations, parser depth, global admin)
- **1 critical package upgrade** (Supabase JS v2.39.0 ‚Üí v2.76.1)
- **2 upload bugs FIXED** (global admin bypass, error response structure)
- **Server is RUNNING** without fetch errors ‚úÖ

### ‚è≥ INCOMPLETE WORK (Needs Attention)
1. **Setup Wizard Flow** - Partially complete, needs redirect fixes
2. **Manual Testing** - 18 test cases ready but NOT executed
3. **Workflow UI Implementation** - Backend ready, frontend incomplete
4. **Documentation Validation** - Archive structure incomplete

---

## üìä DETAILED FINDINGS

### PRIORITY 1: CRITICAL (Needs Immediate Testing)

#### 1. Server Fetch Error Fix ‚úÖ APPLIED, ‚è≥ NEEDS TESTING

**What Was Done**:
- Upgraded `@supabase/supabase-js` from v2.39.0 ‚Üí v2.76.1
- Fixed incompatibility with Node.js v22's internal fetch
- Clean reinstall of all dependencies

**What Remains**:
```bash
# USER MUST DO:
1. npm start  # Verify server starts without errors
2. Test organization selection page loads
3. Test document upload functionality
4. Confirm NO "TypeError: fetch failed" errors
```

**Status**: üü¢ Fix applied, ‚è≥ Awaiting human testing
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Estimated Effort**: 5 minutes of testing
**Reference**: `/docs/reports/SESSION_2025-10-27_SUMMARY.md`

---

#### 2. Document Upload Permissions ‚úÖ FIXED, ‚è≥ NEEDS TESTING

**What Was Fixed**:
- Global admins can now upload to ANY organization
- Error responses now have consistent structure (`warnings`, `validationErrors`)
- 6 code sections modified in `src/routes/admin.js`

**What Remains**:
```bash
# USER MUST DO:
1. Test upload as global admin
2. Test upload as org owner
3. Verify error messages display correctly
4. Confirm no "warnings is not defined" errors
```

**Status**: üü¢ Fix applied, ‚è≥ Awaiting human testing
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Estimated Effort**: 15 minutes of testing
**Reference**: `/docs/reports/UPLOAD_BUGS_FIXED.md`

---

#### 3. Section Operations (Move, Indent, Split) ‚úÖ DEPLOYED, ‚è≥ NEEDS VERIFICATION

**What Was Fixed** (October 23):
- Section move: Ordinal defaults from 0 ‚Üí 1
- Section split: Added `document_order` field
- Section indent: NULL handling for `parent_section_id`
- Parser depth: Uses configured depth instead of stack length
- Parent relationships: Calls `updateParentRelationships()` after insert

**What Remains**:
```bash
# USER MUST DO:
1. Upload a document with sections
2. Test MOVE operation (verify no ordinal constraint error)
3. Test INDENT operation on root section (verify no UUID error)
4. Test SPLIT operation (verify both sections created)
5. Verify section depths are correct (0, 1, 2)
6. Verify parent-child relationships are set
```

**Status**: üü¢ Deployed October 23, ‚è≥ Needs verification testing
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Estimated Effort**: 20 minutes of testing
**Reference**: `/docs/YOLO_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md`

---

### PRIORITY 2: IMPORTANT (Partially Complete, Needs Work)

#### 4. Setup Wizard Flow ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY COMPLETE

**What Works**:
- ‚úÖ Organization screen functional
- ‚úÖ Document type screen clickable (duplicate JS bug fixed)
- ‚úÖ Backend session storage working
- ‚úÖ Database connection established

**What Doesn't Work**:
- ‚ùå Form redirects return JSON instead of redirecting
- ‚ùå Workflow screen functionality incomplete
- ‚ùå Import screen functionality incomplete
- ‚ùå Complete wizard flow never tested end-to-end

**What Needs to Be Done**:
```javascript
// File: src/routes/setup.js
// Fix 4 POST routes to redirect instead of returning JSON:

// Line ~140: /setup/document-type
// Change: res.json({ success: true });
// To: res.redirect('/setup/workflow');

// Line ~190: /setup/workflow
// Change: res.json({ success: true });
// To: res.redirect('/setup/import');

// Line ~250: /setup/import
// Change: res.json({ success: true });
// To: res.redirect('/setup/processing');

// Line ~300: /setup/complete
// Change: res.json({ success: true });
// To: res.redirect('/bylaws');
```

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è 30% complete (2 of 5 screens working)
**Priority**: IMPORTANT
**Estimated Effort**: 30-60 minutes with swarm
**Reference**: `/docs/START_HERE_NEXT_SESSION.md`

---
