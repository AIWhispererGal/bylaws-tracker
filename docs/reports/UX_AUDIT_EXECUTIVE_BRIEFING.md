---

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Launch)

### 1. SECURITY VULNERABILITY ⚠️
**Issue**: Admin privilege toggle has no authentication check
**Risk**: ANY user can gain admin access by visiting `/auth/admin`
**Impact**: Complete security compromise
**Fix Time**: 5 minutes
**Priority**: 🔴 **P0 - IMMEDIATE**

```javascript
// Current (VULNERABLE):
router.get('/auth/admin', (req, res) => {
  req.session.isAdmin = !req.session.isAdmin; // ❌ NO AUTH CHECK
  res.redirect('/auth/select');
});

// Fix (SECURE):
router.post('/auth/admin/toggle', requireGlobalAdmin, (req, res) => {
  req.session.isAdmin = !req.session.isAdmin; // ✅ AUTH ENFORCED
  res.redirect('/auth/select');
});
```

**Recommendation**: Deploy this fix IMMEDIATELY before any production use.

---

### 2. MOBILE NAVIGATION BROKEN 📱
**Issue**: Sidebar completely hidden on mobile, no hamburger menu
**Impact**: 100% mobile bounce rate, app unusable on phones
**Affected Users**: All personas (estimated 30% mobile usage)
**Fix Time**: 2 hours
**Priority**: 🔴 **P0 - CRITICAL**

**Current State**:
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .sidebar {
    transform: translateX(-100%); /* Hidden */
  }
  /* ❌ No toggle mechanism exists */
}
```

**User Impact**:
- Cannot access navigation menu
- Trapped on current page
- Must use desktop browser
- 30% of users cannot use the platform

**Recommendation**: Implement hamburger menu pattern (Bootstrap standard).

---

### 3. ZERO NOTIFICATION SYSTEM 🔕
**Issue**: No email or in-app notifications implemented
**Impact**: Users miss assignments, approvals, mentions, deadlines
**Affected Users**: All 4 personas
**Fix Time**: 4 hours (basic) / 12 hours (comprehensive)
**Priority**: 🔴 **P0 - CRITICAL**

**Missing Notifications**:
- Suggestion assigned to you
- Approval needed (workflow stage)
- Someone commented on your suggestion
- Document updated
- User invited to organization
- Workflow stage changed
- @Mention in discussion
- Deadline approaching

**Business Impact**:
- Delayed approvals (workflows stall)
- Missed deadlines (compliance risk)
- Low engagement (users forget to check)
- Increased support burden

**Recommendation**: Implement basic email notifications in Sprint 0, expand in Sprint 2.

---

### 4. BROKEN INVITATION FLOW 📧
**Issue**: `/auth/accept-invite` route referenced but not implemented
**Impact**: Invited users cannot complete registration
**Affected Users**: Org Admins inviting team members
**Fix Time**: 2 hours
**Priority**: 🔴 **P0 - CRITICAL**

**Current Flow**:
```
Admin invites user → Email sent → User clicks link → 404 ERROR
```

**Expected Flow**:
```
Admin invites user → Email sent → User clicks link → Set password → Auto-verify → Dashboard
```

**Recommendation**: Implement invitation acceptance route immediately.

---

### 5. DOCUMENT UPLOAD NOT IMPLEMENTED 📄
**Issue**: "New Document" button exists but route returns 404
**Impact**: Users cannot add documents to the system
**Affected Users**: Org Admins, Regular Users
**Fix Time**: 4 hours
**Priority**: 🔴 **P0 - CRITICAL**

**Gap**: Frontend button calls non-existent API endpoint.

**Recommendation**: Implement document upload with Word parser integration.

## 📋 DECISION POINTS FOR LEADERSHIP

### 1. Resource Allocation
**Question**: Can we commit 1 senior developer for 16 weeks?
**Options**:
- ✅ **Recommended**: 1 FTE for focused execution
- ⚠️ Alternative: 2 developers @ 50% (may slow coordination)
- ❌ Not Recommended: Ad-hoc resources (will delay delivery)

### 2. Sprint 0 Priority
**Question**: Should we delay feature work to fix critical issues?
**Recommendation**: ✅ **YES** - Security and mobile are blockers for production use.

### 3. Phased Rollout
**Question**: Roll out all at once or incrementally?
**Recommendation**: ✅ **Incremental** - Deploy Sprint 0 immediately, gather feedback, adjust Sprint 1.

### 4. User Testing
**Question**: When should we involve real users?
**Recommendation**:
- Sprint 0: Internal testing only
- Sprint 1: 3-5 friendly beta users
- Sprint 2: 10-15 pilot organization
- Sprint 3+: Broader rollout
