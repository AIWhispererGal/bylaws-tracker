# RLS Isolation Test Results
**Multi-Tenant Data Security Verification for 99 Neighborhood Councils**

---

## Executive Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Test Suite**: `/database/tests/rls_isolation_test.sql`
**Platform**: Supabase PostgreSQL Multi-Tenant SaaS

### Current Status: 🔴 **CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE**

**Row Level Security (RLS) is currently DISABLED on all tables.**

This was done intentionally to fix infinite recursion issues (see `database/migrations/004_fix_rls_recursion.sql`) but creates a severe security vulnerability for multi-tenant production deployments.

---

## Test Architecture

### Test Coverage

The test suite validates 7 critical security domains across 22 individual tests:

| Test Suite | Tests | Focus Area |
|------------|-------|------------|
| **Suite 1**: Organization Isolation | 3 | Cross-tenant organization visibility |
| **Suite 2**: Document Isolation | 4 | Document access control |
| **Suite 3**: Section Isolation | 4 | Section-level data segregation |
| **Suite 4**: Suggestion Isolation | 4 | Suggestion privacy |
| **Suite 5**: Anonymous Access | 2 | Setup wizard permissions |
| **Suite 6**: CRUD Permissions | 4 | Create/Update/Delete operations |
| **Suite 7**: Advanced Leakage | 4 | Attack vector testing |

### Test Organizations

Two isolated test councils with distinct users:

```
Test Council A (ID: 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111)
├── Users:
│   ├── user-a@test.com (member)
│   └── admin-a@test.com (admin)
├── Documents: 1 (Council A Bylaws)
├── Sections: 2 (Article I, Article II)
└── Suggestions: 1

Test Council B (ID: 22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222)
├── Users:
│   ├── user-b@test.com (member)
│   └── admin-b@test.com (admin)
├── Documents: 1 (Council B Bylaws)
├── Sections: 2 (Article I, Article II)
└── Suggestions: 1
```

## Expected vs Actual Results

### When RLS is **DISABLED** (Current State)

#### ❌ Expected Behavior (Secure Multi-Tenant):
```sql
-- User A tries to see Council B documents
SELECT * FROM documents WHERE organization_id = 'council-b-id';
-- Should return: ZERO ROWS (blocked by RLS policy)
```

#### ⚠️ Actual Behavior (RLS Disabled):
```sql
-- User A tries to see Council B documents
SELECT * FROM documents WHERE organization_id = 'council-b-id';
-- Actually returns: ALL Council B documents (RLS not enforcing!)
```

### Test Results Matrix

- ⚠️ **Tests Failing with RLS OFF**: 12/22 (cross-tenant isolation)
- 🔴 **Critical Security Vulnerabilities**: 12 data leakage vectors

---

## Vulnerability Analysis

### 1. Cross-Organization Data Leakage

**Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL**

**Issue**: Any authenticated user can query ANY organization's data.

**Attack Vector**:
```sql
-- User from Council A runs:
SELECT * FROM documents;
-- Returns documents from ALL 99 councils, not just Council A!
```

**Impact**:
- Bylaws content exposure across councils
- Amendment suggestion visibility
- Workflow status disclosure
- User activity tracking across organizations

**Affected Tables**:
- `organizations` (should only see own org)
- `documents` (should only see own org's documents)
- `document_sections` (should only see sections in accessible docs)
- `suggestions` (should only see suggestions for accessible docs)
- `workflow_templates` (should only see own org's workflows)
- `document_workflows` (should only see own org's workflow instances)
- `section_workflow_states` (should only see states for accessible sections)

### 2. Unauthorized Modification Risk

**Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL**

**Issue**: Users can potentially modify other organizations' data.

**Attack Vector**:
```sql
-- User from Council A runs:
UPDATE documents
SET status = 'archived'
WHERE organization_id = 'council-b-id';
-- Succeeds! Council B's document is now archived by Council A user!
```

**Impact**:
- Document tampering
- Unauthorized status changes
- Suggestion manipulation
- Workflow interference

### 3. JOIN Attack Vectors

**Severity**: 🔴 **HIGH**

**Issue**: Complex queries can extract cross-tenant data via joins.

**Attack Vector**:
```sql
-- Extract all organizations and their document counts
SELECT o.name, o.slug, COUNT(d.id) as doc_count
FROM organizations o
LEFT JOIN documents d ON o.id = d.organization_id
GROUP BY o.id, o.name, o.slug;
-- Returns data for ALL 99 councils!
```

**Impact**:
- Census of all organizations on platform
- Activity pattern analysis
- Competitive intelligence gathering

### 4. Anonymous Access Confusion

**Severity**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**

**Issue**: Setup wizard needs to create organizations anonymously, but current approach allows too much access.

**Current State**: RLS disabled entirely for setup convenience.

**Better Approach**:
- Use service role key for setup operations
- Enable RLS with specific policies for anonymous INSERT
- Restrict anonymous SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE

---

## Acceptable Use Cases for RLS Disabled

RLS can remain disabled ONLY in these scenarios:

### ✅ Acceptable:
1. **Single-Tenant Deployment**: Only 1 organization will ever use the system
2. **Trusted Internal Environment**: All users have access to all data (e.g., corporate policy portal)
3. **Development/Testing**: Local development with test data only
4. **Initial Setup Phase**: Brief period during platform initialization (must re-enable before production)

### ❌ NOT Acceptable:
1. **Multi-Tenant SaaS**: Multiple independent organizations (e.g., 99 neighborhood councils)
2. **Public-Facing Platform**: External users with varying permissions
3. **Production Environments**: Any live system with sensitive data
4. **Compliance Requirements**: Systems subject to privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

---

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate (Before Production Launch) 🚨

**Priority**: 🔴 **CRITICAL - DO NOT DEPLOY WITHOUT THIS**

1. **Create Proper RLS Policies** (`database/migrations/005_enable_rls_properly.sql`)
   ```sql
   -- Enable RLS
   ALTER TABLE organizations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE documents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   -- ... all other tables

   -- Simple, non-recursive policies
   CREATE POLICY "Users see own organizations"
     ON organizations FOR SELECT
     USING (
       id IN (
         SELECT organization_id
         FROM user_organizations
         WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
       )
     );
   ```

2. **Configure Authentication**
   - Set up Supabase Auth properly
   - Ensure `auth.uid()` is populated in all requests
   - Create service role key for backend operations

3. **Test RLS Policies**
   - Run this test suite again: `database/tests/rls_isolation_test.sql`
   - Verify ALL tests pass with RLS enabled
   - Test from application layer with real JWT tokens

4. **Document Setup Wizard Flow**
   - Use service role key for initial org creation
   - Switch to authenticated flow after org exists
   - Document in `docs/SETUP_WIZARD_AUTH.md`

### Phase 2: Hardening (Post-Launch)

**Priority**: 🟡 **HIGH**

1. **Advanced RLS Policies**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) policies
   - Field-level restrictions (e.g., hide author emails)
   - Audit logging for policy violations

2. **Security Auditing**
   - Regular RLS policy reviews
   - Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
   - Penetration testing for data leakage

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Index RLS filter columns (organization_id, user_id)
   - Benchmark query performance with policies
   - Consider materialized views for complex policies

### Phase 3: Monitoring (Ongoing)

**Priority**: 🟢 **MEDIUM**

1. **Policy Effectiveness Monitoring**
   - Log RLS policy denials
   - Track cross-tenant query attempts
   - Alert on suspicious access patterns

2. **Compliance Reporting**
   - Automated RLS status reports
   - Data access audit trails
   - Regular security assessments

## Sample RLS Policy Templates

### Template 1: Simple Organization Isolation

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE documents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Users see only their organization's documents
CREATE POLICY "organization_isolation" ON documents
  FOR ALL
  USING (
    organization_id IN (
      SELECT organization_id
      FROM user_organizations
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

### Template 2: Role-Based Access

```sql
-- Policy: Admins can modify, members can read
CREATE POLICY "admin_modify_member_read" ON documents
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_organizations
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        AND organization_id = documents.organization_id
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "admin_only_modify" ON documents
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_organizations
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        AND organization_id = documents.organization_id
        AND role IN ('admin', 'owner')
    )
  );
```

### Template 3: Anonymous Setup Wizard

```sql
-- Policy: Allow anonymous organization creation
CREATE POLICY "anonymous_create_org" ON organizations
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Allow if using service role OR anonymous with specific JWT claim
    current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::json->>'role' = 'service_role'
    OR
    current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::json->>'setup_wizard' = 'true'
  );

-- Policy: Authenticated users see only their orgs
CREATE POLICY "authenticated_see_own_orgs" ON organizations
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    id IN (
      SELECT organization_id
      FROM user_organizations
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

## Testing Procedure

### How to Run the Test Suite

1. **Execute the SQL test file**:
   ```bash
   # Via Supabase CLI
   supabase db query < database/tests/rls_isolation_test.sql

   # Via psql
   psql -h your-db-host -U postgres -d your-db-name \
        -f database/tests/rls_isolation_test.sql

   # Via Supabase Dashboard
   # Copy/paste contents into SQL Editor and run
   ```

2. **Review the output**:
   - Look for ✅ **PASSED** tests (expected behavior working)
   - Look for ❌ **FAILED** tests (issues to fix)
   - Look for ⚠️ **WARNING** tests (RLS disabled alerts)

3. **Interpret results**:
   - If RLS is **DISABLED**: Expect many warnings about cross-tenant access
   - If RLS is **ENABLED**: Expect most tests to pass with proper isolation

### After Enabling RLS

Run the test suite again and expect:

```
🔒 RLS Status Check:
================================
  ✅ organizations: RLS ENABLED
  ✅ documents: RLS ENABLED
  ✅ document_sections: RLS ENABLED
  ✅ suggestions: RLS ENABLED
  ... (all tables enabled)
================================

🧪 TEST SUITE 1: Organization Isolation
========================================
  ✅ Test 1.1 PASSED: User A can see Council A
  ✅ Test 1.2 PASSED: User A cannot see Council B
  ✅ Test 1.3 PASSED: User B can see Council B

... (all tests passing)

### Previous Issues

- **Infinite Recursion**: RLS policies were checking `user_organizations` recursively
- **Solution**: Temporarily disabled RLS to unblock setup wizard
- **Next Step**: Re-enable with properly designed non-recursive policies

### Design Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: RLS at database + application-level checks
2. **Fail Secure**: Deny by default, allow explicitly
3. **Minimal Privilege**: Users get only what they need
4. **Audit Trail**: Log all policy decisions
5. **Performance**: Index foreign keys used in policies

## Conclusion

### Current State: 🔴 NOT PRODUCTION READY

The platform's multi-tenant architecture is **currently insecure** due to disabled RLS policies. While acceptable for development and single-tenant deployments, this configuration **MUST NOT** be used for production with 99 independent neighborhood councils.

### Required Before Launch:

✅ Enable RLS on all multi-tenant tables
✅ Create non-recursive isolation policies
✅ Configure Supabase Auth properly
✅ Run and PASS all 22 isolation tests
✅ Document setup wizard authentication flow
✅ Train team on RLS troubleshooting

### Success Criteria:

When properly configured:
- ✅ Council A users see ONLY Council A data
- ✅ Council B users see ONLY Council B data
- ✅ No cross-tenant data leakage via any query pattern
- ✅ Anonymous users can create orgs but not read others
- ✅ All 22 tests pass with RLS enabled

**Next Action**: Implement `database/migrations/005_enable_rls_properly.sql` with non-recursive policies, then re-run this test suite to validate security posture.
