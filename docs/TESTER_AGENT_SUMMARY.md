## Key Testing Patterns

### Mock Services
All tests use comprehensive mocks:
```javascript
// Supabase client with realistic behavior
const mockSupabase = createMockSupabase({
  sections: [...],
  suggestions: [...],
  locks: [...]
});

// Express request/response objects
const mockReq = { session: {...}, supabase: {...} };
const mockRes = { status: jest.fn(), json: jest.fn() };
```

### Test Structure (AAA Pattern)
```javascript
test('should perform action when condition', async () => {
  // Arrange - set up test data
  const mockData = {...};
  const service = new Service(mockData);

  // Act - execute the function
  const result = await service.doSomething();

  // Assert - verify the outcome
  expect(result).toBe(expected);
});
```

### Error Handling
```javascript
// Test both success and failure paths
test('should handle errors gracefully', async () => {
  const mockError = { error: new Error('Database error') };
  const result = await service.query(mockError);

  expect(result.success).toBe(false);
  expect(result.error).toBe('Database error');
});
```
