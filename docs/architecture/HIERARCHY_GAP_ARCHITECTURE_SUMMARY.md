## 🎯 Problem Statement (60-Second Summary)

**The Issue:**
Documents may have hierarchy gaps - missing intermediate levels in their structure:

```
❌ PROBLEM:
Article I (depth 0)
  └─ Subparagraph (a) (depth 3)   [MISSING: Section (1), Subsection (2)]

Current indent/dedent operations FAIL because:
- No previous sibling to indent under
- No valid parent to dedent to
```

**Root Causes:**
1. Parser allows depth jumps (intentional flexibility)
2. User manual editing can create gaps
3. Database preserves parser-calculated depths
4. No gap repair mechanism exists

**Impact:**
- Users cannot restructure documents with gaps
- Uploaded documents may have invalid structures
- Manual editing is frustrating
- Document quality suffers

---

## 🔍 Solution Options (High-Level)

### Option 1: Auto-Create Missing Levels
**Concept:** Automatically insert placeholder sections when gaps detected

**Pros:** Automatic, fast, maintains hierarchy integrity
**Cons:** Surprising to users, creates clutter, hard to undo

**Best For:** High-volume imports with predictable structure

---

### Option 2: Hierarchy Repair Tool ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Concept:** Batch tool to analyze document, show gaps, let users fix

**Pros:** User control, customizable, educational, excellent audit trail
**Cons:** Requires user action, UI complexity

**Best For:** Uploaded documents with gaps, quarterly cleanup

---

### Option 3: Smart Indent with Level Selection ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Concept:** Enhanced indent button with modal to select target depth

**Pros:** Intuitive, prevents gaps, flexible, clear UI
**Cons:** Extra clicks, doesn't fix existing gaps

**Best For:** Manual document editing, preventing future gaps

---

### Option 4: Relaxed Hierarchy (Allow Gaps)
**Concept:** Change system to allow non-consecutive depths as valid

**Pros:** Simplest implementation, flexible, no restrictions
**Cons:** Confusing for users, odd citations, violates standards

**Best For:** Intentionally non-hierarchical documents (rare)

---

## 🏆 Final Recommendation

### **HYBRID SOLUTION: Option 2 + Option 3**

**Why Both?**
- **Option 2 (Repair Tool)** → Fixes existing gaps in uploaded documents
- **Option 3 (Smart Indent)** → Prevents new gaps during manual editing

**Comprehensive Coverage:**
```
Past Issues (uploaded docs with gaps)
    ↓
Option 2: Hierarchy Repair Tool
    ↓
Clean document structure
    ↓
Future Editing (manual operations)
    ↓
Option 3: Smart Indent Modal
    ↓
Gap-free documents maintained
```

---

## 💡 Key Architectural Decisions

### ADR-027: Hierarchy Gap Resolution Strategy

**Decision:** Implement hybrid user-guided approach (Option 2 + 3)

**Context:**
- Documents have hierarchy gaps from parser flexibility and manual editing
- Current indent/dedent operations cannot fix gaps
- Users need both batch repair AND prevention

**Consequences:**

**Positive:**
- ✅ Users have full control over repairs
- ✅ Clear audit trail of all changes
- ✅ Educational - users learn document structure
- ✅ Prevents future gaps proactively
- ✅ Comprehensive solution

**Negative:**
- ⚠️ Requires user action (not fully automatic)
- ⚠️ UI complexity (modal interactions)
- ⚠️ More code to maintain (600+ LOC)

**Neutral:**
- Existing gaps remain until user runs repair tool
- Users can choose to keep gaps if intentional
