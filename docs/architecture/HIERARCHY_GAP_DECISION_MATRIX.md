## Business Impact Analysis

### Option 1: Auto-Create Missing Levels

**Business Value:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Zero user friction** - Works automatically
- ✅ **Fast** - Gaps fixed instantly during operations
- ✅ **Consistent** - All gaps handled uniformly

**Cons:**
- ❌ **User confusion** - Unexpected sections appear
- ❌ **Quality concerns** - Generic auto-created content
- ❌ **Hard to undo** - Difficult to revert auto-creations

**Use Cases:**
- High-volume document imports with predictable structure
- Internal documents where perfect accuracy is not critical

**Risk Level:** 🟡 **MEDIUM** - User acceptance risk

---

### Option 2: Hierarchy Repair Tool

**Business Value:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

**Pros:**
- ✅ **User trust** - Full transparency and control
- ✅ **Quality** - Users name sections appropriately
- ✅ **Batch efficiency** - Fix entire document at once
- ✅ **Educational** - Users understand document structure

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ **Requires action** - Users must initiate repair
- ⚠️ **One-time fix** - Doesn't prevent new gaps from manual editing

**Use Cases:**
- Uploaded documents with gaps (e.g., poorly formatted PDFs)
- Migrated legacy documents
- Quarterly document cleanup operations

**Risk Level:** 🟢 **LOW** - High user acceptance

---

### Option 3: Smart Indent with Level Selection

**Business Value:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
