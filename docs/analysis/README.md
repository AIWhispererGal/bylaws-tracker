## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Considerations

### California Brown Act Compliance
**IMPORTANT:** The system is designed to comply with California's open meeting law (Brown Act).

**Key Rules:**
- ‚ùå **NEVER** display running vote counts
- ‚ùå **NEVER** show which committee members voted for what
- ‚úÖ **ONLY** show final committee decisions (approved/rejected)
- ‚úÖ **ONLY** track public support (non-committee members)

**Database Schema:** Intentionally does NOT include committee vote tracking.

---

### Security Requirements
**IMPORTANT:** All RLS policies must be tested before production deployment.

**Critical Checks:**
- ‚úÖ Cross-tenant isolation (User A cannot see User B's org data)
- ‚úÖ Role-based permissions (Staff cannot approve, committee can)
- ‚úÖ Service role key never exposed to client
- ‚úÖ All input validated and sanitized
- ‚úÖ Audit logs capture all security events

---

### Performance Requirements
**IMPORTANT:** Large organizations (>1000 sections) need optimization.

**Optimization Strategies:**
- ‚úÖ Materialized view for workflow progress
- ‚úÖ 15+ strategic indexes
- ‚úÖ Pagination on all list endpoints
- ‚úÖ JWT caching for permission checks
- ‚úÖ Query timeouts and connection pooling
