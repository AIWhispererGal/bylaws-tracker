### ðŸ“„ 5. Security & Compliance Analysis
**File:** `/docs/analysis/security-considerations.md`

**Security Layers:**
1. **Network Security** - HTTPS, CORS, rate limiting
2. **Authentication** - Supabase Auth with JWT tokens

5. **Data Protection** - Encryption at rest and in transit

**Threat Model:**
- STRIDE analysis for all components
- 4 attack scenarios with mitigations
- Defense in depth strategy

**Compliance:**
- **California Brown Act** - No vote counting, transparency requirements
- **GDPR** - Data export, right to erasure, cookie policy
- **Audit Trail** - 7-year retention for compliance

**RLS Policies:**
- Multi-tenant isolation on all tables
- Role-based workflow permissions
- Service role bypass for admin operations
- 20+ tested security policies

---

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Role Storage
**Decision:** JSONB permissions field in `user_organizations`
**Rationale:** Flexible, fast lookups, can add custom permissions without schema changes

### 2. Workflow State Machine
**Decision:** Table-driven state transitions with `section_workflow_states`
**Rationale:** Configurable workflows, complete audit trail, supports N-stage approval

### 3. Document Versioning
**Decision:** Semantic versioning with JSONB snapshots
**Rationale:** Standard version numbering, point-in-time recovery, diff comparison

### 4. Section Locking
**Decision:** Boolean flag on `document_sections` + workflow state
**Rationale:** Simple implementation, fast queries, clear ownership

### 5. Brown Act Compliance
**Decision:** No committee vote tracking in database schema
**Rationale:** Legal requirement, only track public support and final decisions

---

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes
- 15+ new indexes on frequently queried columns
- Partial indexes for common filters (locked sections, active documents)
- GIN index on JSONB permissions
- Materialized view for workflow progress (cached statistics)

### Query Optimization
- Path-based queries for section hierarchy
- Batch loading of workflow states
- Caching of permission checks in JWT
- Pagination on all list endpoints

### Expected Performance
- Workflow status query: < 100ms
- Permission check: < 10ms (JWT cache)
- User list load: < 200ms
- Dashboard load: < 500ms (with materialized view)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Mitigation Required)
**Risk:** RLS policy misconfiguration allows cross-tenant access
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing suite, peer review of all policies, automated tests in CI/CD

**Risk:** Brown Act compliance violation (vote counting displayed)
**Mitigation:** Legal review of UI, database schema verification, strict no-vote-tracking policy

### Medium Risk (Monitor)
**Risk:** Performance degradation with large organizations (>1000 sections)
**Mitigation:** Materialized views, pagination, caching strategy, load testing

**Risk:** Migration failures on production database
**Mitigation:** Test on staging, backup before migration, rollback scripts ready

### Low Risk (Accept)
**Risk:** User confusion with new role system
**Mitigation:** User training, tooltips, contextual help, onboarding flow

## Open Questions for Stakeholders

### Role Management
1. Should "Committee Member" be the official role name, or something simpler?
2. Should suggesters be able to self-register, or invitation-only?
3. What's the preferred default role for new invitations?

### Workflow
4. Should board members be able to send sections back to committee?
5. What happens to locked sections if the locker's account is deleted?
6. Should there be a "draft" stage before committee review?

### Versioning
7. When should major versions be created (vs. minor)?
8. Should old versions be exportable as PDFs?
9. How long should version history be retained?

### Compliance
10. Has legal counsel reviewed the Brown Act compliance approach?
11. Are there any other California open meeting laws to consider?

---
