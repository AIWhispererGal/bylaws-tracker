# üîç Smoking Gun Search - What to Look For

Based on your finding that `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` doesn't exist, search for these specific patterns in your Supabase Database Logs:

## Search Terms (in order of importance)

### 1. Database Reset/Recreation
```sql
DROP SCHEMA
DROP DATABASE
CREATE DATABASE
RESET
```

**What to look for:**
- `DROP SCHEMA supabase_migrations CASCADE`
- `DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE`
- Any schema drops

### 2. Migration Table Operations
```sql
DROP TABLE supabase_migrations.schema_migrations
CREATE SCHEMA supabase_migrations
```

### 3. Bulk Data Removal
```sql
TRUNCATE
DELETE FROM
```

### 4. Database Restoration
```sql
pg_restore
RESTORE
```

## üéØ Timeline Analysis

Based on your finding at **2025-10-28 17:14:27 UTC** (which is **5:14 PM today**):

**Question 1:** When did you last successfully access the app?
- If it was working this morning, something happened TODAY
- Check logs between then and 5:14 PM

**Question 2:** Did you make any changes via Supabase dashboard today?
- Did you try to run a migration?
- Did you click any "Reset" buttons?
- Did you use the SQL Editor?

**Question 3:** Did you switch to a different Supabase project?
- Check your .env file
- Verify the project ID matches what you think it should be

In Supabase Dashboard Activity logs, look for:

### Critical Actions:
- ‚ùå "Reset database"
- ‚ùå "Restore from backup"
- ‚ùå "Run migration"
- ‚ùå "Execute SQL"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Schema created"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Schema dropped"

## üß© The Missing Piece

Since `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` doesn't exist, but your application tables DO exist (they're just empty), this suggests:

### Scenario A: Manual Table Recreation
Someone:
1. Dropped all tables
2. Manually recreated them (without data)
3. Did NOT run the migration system

**Evidence to look for:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE organizations (...)
CREATE TABLE users (...)
CREATE TABLE documents (...)
-- etc.
```

### Scenario B: Fresh Database with Schema Applied
Someone:
1. Reset the database
2. Applied the schema manually
3. But did NOT import data

### Scenario C: Wrong Supabase Project
You're connected to a **different** Supabase project that:
- Has the same schema structure
- But no data
- And no migrations run

**How to verify:**
```bash
# Check what project your .env points to
cat .env | grep SUPABASE_URL

# Expected: https://auuzurghrjokbqzivfca.supabase.co
# If different: You're in the wrong project!
```

## üìã Evidence Collection Update

Fill this out based on what you find:

```markdown
=== MIGRATION TABLE MISSING - EVIDENCE ===

Timestamp of Missing Table Error: 2025-10-28 17:14:27 UTC
User in Dashboard: postgres (via dashboard)

Database Log Searches:

1. Searched for "DROP SCHEMA":
   - Found: [YES/NO]
   - If YES: [paste the log entry]
   - Timestamp: [when]

2. Searched for "CREATE SCHEMA supabase_migrations":
   - Found: [YES/NO]
   - If YES: [paste the log entry]

3. Searched for "TRUNCATE":
   - Found: [YES/NO]
   - If YES: [paste the log entry]

4. Searched for "DROP TABLE":
   - Found: [YES/NO]
   - If YES: [paste the log entry]

5. Checked .env SUPABASE_URL:
   - URL: [paste from .env]
   - Matches expected project? [YES/NO]

6. Last successful app access:
   - When: [time/date]
   - What you were doing: [describe]

7. Dashboard Activity Log shows:
   - Any "Reset" actions? [YES/NO]
   - Any "Restore" actions? [YES/NO]
   - Any suspicious SQL executions? [YES/NO]
   - If YES to any: [paste details]

=== PROBABLE CAUSE ===
Based on evidence:
[ ] Wrong Supabase project (check .env)
[ ] Database was reset via dashboard
[ ] Schema was dropped and recreated
[ ] Migration system was corrupted
[ ] Unknown - need more investigation
```

## üö® URGENT: Check This First

Before going further, verify you're in the RIGHT project:

```bash
# Run this in your project directory
cat .env | grep SUPABASE_URL
```

**Expected output:**
```
SUPABASE_URL=https://auuzurghrjokbqzivfca.supabase.co
```

**If it says something else:** You're connected to a different project! That would explain why there's no data.

**Possible wrong URLs:**
- `https://[different-id].supabase.co` = Different project
- `http://localhost:54321` = Local Supabase (not production)
- Any other URL = Wrong environment

---

## üí° Quick Diagnostic

Run this to check your current Supabase connection:

```bash
# Check what your app thinks is the Supabase URL
node -e "require('dotenv').config(); console.log('SUPABASE_URL:', process.env.SUPABASE_URL); console.log('Expected: https://auuzurghrjokbqzivfca.supabase.co');"
```

This will show you immediately if you're connected to the right project.

## üéØ Next Actions

**Priority 1:** Verify .env project URL
**Priority 2:** Search logs for "DROP SCHEMA"
**Priority 3:** Search logs for "TRUNCATE" or "DELETE FROM"
**Priority 4:** Check Dashboard Activity log
