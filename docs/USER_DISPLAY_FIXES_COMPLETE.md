# User Display Fixes - COMPLETE ✅

## Issues Fixed

### Issue #4: Superuser Role Badge Visibility ✅
**Problem**: Role badge for SUPERUSER/global_admin had white text on white background (invisible)
**Location**: `/admin/users` page, line 462 in `views/admin/users.ejs`

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive CSS styling for ALL role types with proper contrast
- global_admin/superuser: Red background (#dc3545) with white text and border
- owner: Purple background (#6f42c1) with white text
- admin: Blue-purple background (#667eea) with white text
- member/editor: Green background (#28a745) with white text
- viewer: Gray background (#6c757d) with white text
- All use `!important` to ensure override of any conflicting styles

### Issue #5: Last Active Shows "Never" for All Users ✅
**Problem**: All users showed "Never" for last active date
**Root Causes**:
1. Route wasn't fetching user data - just rendering empty template
2. Template expected data that wasn't being passed
3. Display logic needed improvement for null values

**Solution**:
1. Modified `/admin/users` route in `src/routes/admin.js` to:
   - Fetch user_organizations data with last_active field
   - Fetch user details from users table
   - Attempt to get last_sign_in_at from auth.users (if available)
   - Combine all data sources for comprehensive user info
   - Pass complete user data to template

2. Updated template display logic:
   - Shows actual date if last_active exists
   - Shows "Not tracked" instead of "Never" when null
   - Formats dates properly using toLocaleDateString()

## Files Modified

1. **views/admin/users.ejs**
   - Lines 231-268: Added comprehensive role badge CSS styling
   - Lines 475-490: Updated user meta display with last active field

2. **src/routes/admin.js**
   - Lines 27-136: Complete rewrite of `/admin/users` GET route
   - Now fetches actual user data from database
   - Combines data from multiple sources (user_organizations, users, auth.users)
   - Properly passes all required variables to template

3. **tests/test-user-display-fix.js** (NEW)
   - Created comprehensive test script to verify fixes
   - Tests CSS classes, data fetching, and display logic

## Technical Details

### Data Sources Combined:
- `user_organizations` table: role, is_active, joined_at, last_active
- `users` table: email, full_name, is_global_admin
- `auth.users` (Supabase Auth): last_sign_in_at

### CSS Specificity:
- Used `!important` declarations to ensure role badge styles override any defaults
- Each role has distinct, high-contrast color scheme for accessibility

### Fallback Handling:
- Email fallback: Shows 'Unknown' if email missing
- Name fallback: Uses email if full_name not set
- Last active fallback: Shows 'Not tracked' if no date available
- Role detection: Checks is_global_admin flag to override organization role

## Testing Results

✅ All role badges now have proper visibility with good contrast
✅ User data is fetched and displayed correctly
✅ Last active field shows appropriate values or fallback text
✅ Global admin/superuser roles are properly detected and styled

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Consider adding a background job to update last_active on user activity
2. Could add Supabase function to sync last_sign_in_at to last_active field
3. May want to add tooltips explaining what "Not tracked" means

## Verification

To verify these fixes work:
1. Navigate to `/admin/users` as an admin user
2. Check that all role badges are visible with proper colors
3. Verify user data is displayed (email, name, role, etc.)
4. Confirm "Last active" shows dates or "Not tracked" instead of "Never"
