# Onboarding Flow Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the organization onboarding flow with improved document upload, parsing preview, and error handling. The current parser achieves **96.84% content retention**, and these enhancements will make that success visible and actionable for users.

---

## Design Documents

Three comprehensive design documents have been created:

1. **[ONBOARDING_FLOW.md](./ONBOARDING_FLOW.md)** - Complete flow design with UX wireframes
2. **[ERROR_MESSAGES.md](./ERROR_MESSAGES.md)** - Error handling matrix and user guidance
3. **[FORMATTING_GUIDE.md](./FORMATTING_GUIDE.md)** - Document preparation guide for users

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Parse Preview & Validation (Week 1-2) 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY

**Goal:** Show users what was parsed before finalizing import

**Backend Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `/api/setup/preview-parse` endpoint
  - Parse document without saving to database
  - Calculate content retention percentage
  - Return preview data with first 3-5 sections
- [ ] Add retention calculator to `wordParser.js`
  - Compare original vs captured text length
  - Return percentage with quality tier (Excellent/Good/Poor)
- [ ] Enhance validation in `setupService.js`
  - Add retention threshold checks
  - Generate actionable warnings
  - Include sample sections in response

**Frontend Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `ParsePreview.jsx` component
  - Display section count and retention %
  - Show quality indicator (green/yellow/red)
  - Preview first 3-5 sections
  - Action buttons: Continue/Re-upload/Manual Setup
- [ ] Create `RetentionIndicator.jsx` component
  - Visual progress bar
  - Color-coded by quality tier
  - Percentage display
  - Quality label
- [ ] Update `document-upload.ejs` view
  - Add preview section (hidden until parsed)
  - Real-time parsing progress
  - Show/hide preview based on results

**API Endpoint:**
```javascript
POST /api/setup/preview-parse
Request: { file: <multipart>, organizationId: "org-123" }
Response: {
  success: true,
  preview: {
    totalSections: 24,
    retentionRate: 96.84,
    quality: "excellent",  // excellent | good | poor
    structure: "article-section",
    articles: 8,
    sections: 16,
    warnings: [],
    sampleSections: [
      { citation: "Article I, Section 1.1", title: "Official Name", preview: "The official..." },
      // ... more samples
    ]
  }
}
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✓ Users see retention percentage before continuing
- ✓ Preview displays in < 5 seconds for typical documents
- ✓ Quality tier (Excellent/Good/Poor) is clear
- ✓ Sample sections are readable and accurate

  - Capture context (file size, sections found, etc.)
  - Track user actions after error
  - Store for analytics
- [ ] Create formatting guide endpoint
  - Serve document templates
  - Provide examples based on error type

**Frontend Tasks:**
- [ ] Create error message components

  - Link to relevant help docs

**Error Message Template:**
```javascript
{
  icon: "❌",
  title: "Low Content Retention Detected",
  message: "Only 78.5% of your document content was captured.",
  details: [
    "Inconsistent section numbering",
    "Missing headers for some content"
  ],
  actions: [
    { label: "View Formatting Guide", action: "showGuide" },
    { label: "Re-upload Document", action: "reupload" },
    { label: "Manual Setup", action: "manual" }
  ],
  errorCode: "PE-002"
}
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✓ Every error has clear, actionable message

  - Provide customization options

**Frontend Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `StructureConfidence.jsx` component
  - Show detected structure
  - Display confidence score
  - Offer override/customize option
- [ ] Build custom structure builder
  - Add/remove hierarchy levels
  - Choose numbering styles
  - Live preview with sample data
- [ ] Update hierarchy configuration view

  - Smooth transition to custom if needed
  - Visual preview of final structure

**Confidence Calculation:**
```javascript
function calculateConfidence(detectedItems, totalLines) {
  // Consistency: How regular is the numbering?
  const consistencyScore = checkNumberingConsistency(detectedItems);

  // Coverage: What % of document is structured?
  const coverageScore = (detectedItems.length / expectedSections) * 100;

  // Pattern strength: How clear are the patterns?
  const patternScore = analyzePatternClarity(detectedItems);

  return (consistencyScore * 0.5 + coverageScore * 0.3 + patternScore * 0.2);
}
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✓ Confidence score accurately reflects quality
- ✓ Low confidence (< 80%) triggers customization prompt
- ✓ Users can easily override auto-detection
- ✓ Custom structures work as well as auto-detected

  }
}
```

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Confidence scoring logic
- [ ] Error classification
- [ ] Sample section extraction

**Services:**
- [ ] Preview without database save
- [ ] Error message mapping
- [ ] Quality tier assignment

### Integration Tests

**End-to-End Flows:**

- [ ] User with Google Docs link (future)

**Metrics to Track:**
- Completion rate (% reaching success)
- Error recovery rate (% successfully recovering)
- Time to complete (minutes)
- User satisfaction (survey)
