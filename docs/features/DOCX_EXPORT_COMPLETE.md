## 🎓 Developer Notes

### Diff Algorithm Choice:
We use **word-level diffing** (not character or line level) because:
- More readable for prose/legal text
- Matches how humans perceive changes
- Balances granularity with clarity

### Color Scheme:
- **Red for deletions** - Universal convention
- **Green for additions** - Per customer request (instead of blue)
- **Black for unchanged** - Standard text color

### Document Structure:
1. Title page with document name and export metadata
2. Summary statistics (changed sections count)
3. Legend explaining formatting
4. Changed sections with Track Changes
5. Footer with tool branding and date
