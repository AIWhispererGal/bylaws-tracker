## üî¥ Issue #1: Setup Wizard Infinite Recursion (CRITICAL)

### Problem
```
Error: Failed to link user to organization: infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'user_organizations'
Location: src/routes/setup.js:933:35
```

### Root Cause
**Duplicate RLS policies** on `user_organizations` table:
- Migration 008c (the fix) WAS applied
- But old broken policies from Migration 008 were NOT fully dropped
- Result: Both broken and fixed policies ran simultaneously
- The broken policies had circular references causing recursion

### Solution Applied
Dropped old duplicate policies in Supabase:
```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users_see_own_memberships_or_global_admin" ON user_organizations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users_update_own_membership_or_global_admin" ON user_organizations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "admins_invite_users_or_global_admin" ON user_organizations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "global_admin_delete_memberships" ON user_organizations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "service_role_manage_memberships" ON user_organizations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Global admins can access all organizations" ON user_organizations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access their organizations" ON user_organizations;
```

### Result
‚úÖ Only clean v3 policies remain:
- `users_see_memberships_v3`
- `users_update_memberships_v3`
- `admins_insert_members_v3`
- `admins_delete_members_v3`
- `service_role_access_v3`
- `service_role_bypass`

## üî¥ Issue #2: User Invite 404 Error

### Problem
```
POST /users/invite ‚Üí 404 Not Found
Error: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
```

### Root Cause
Frontend calling wrong endpoint:
- **Frontend:** `/admin/users/invite` (doesn't exist)
- **Backend:** `/api/users/invite` (exists)

Route mismatch in `/views/admin/users.ejs`

### Solution Applied
Fixed 3 API calls in `/views/admin/users.ejs`:

1. **Line 575:** `/admin/users/invite` ‚Üí `/api/users/invite` ‚úÖ
2. **Line 599:** `/admin/users/${userId}/role` ‚Üí `/api/users/${userId}/role` ‚úÖ
3. **Line 619:** `/admin/users/${userId}` ‚Üí `/api/users/${userId}` ‚úÖ

## üìã Files Modified

### 1. Supabase Database (SQL executed)
- Dropped 7 duplicate RLS policies
- Kept 6 clean v3 policies

### 2. `/views/admin/users.ejs`
- Fixed invite endpoint (line 575)
- Fixed role update endpoint (line 599)
- Fixed user delete endpoint (line 619)

## üéì Technical Lessons Learned

### 1. RLS Policy Recursion Pattern
**Anti-Pattern (causes recursion):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY ON user_organizations USING (
  organization_id IN (
    SELECT organization_id FROM user_organizations  -- ‚ùå Self-reference!
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

**Correct Pattern (uses SECURITY DEFINER):**
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION is_org_admin_for_org(user_id, org_id)
RETURNS BOOLEAN
SECURITY DEFINER  -- Bypasses RLS, prevents recursion
AS $$ ... $$;

CREATE POLICY ON user_organizations USING (
  is_org_admin_for_org(auth.uid(), organization_id)  -- ‚úÖ No recursion
);
```

### 2. Migration Management
- Always verify old policies are fully dropped
- Check for policy name conflicts
- Use version suffixes (`_v3`) for tracking
- Test after applying migrations

### 3. API Route Organization
- Consistent URL patterns across frontend/backend
- `/api/*` for API routes (user-facing)
- `/admin/*` for admin views (page routes)
- Document route mappings

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

### Test Setup Wizard
```bash
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/setup
2. Fill out organization form
3. Submit (should complete without recursion error)
4. Verify redirect to /setup/document-type
```

### Test User Invite
```bash
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/admin/users
2. Click "Invite User"
3. Enter email and role
4. Submit (should work without 404 error)
5. Verify user added to organization
```

### SQL Verification
```sql
-- Check policies
SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'user_organizations'
ORDER BY policyname;

-- Expected: Only _v3 policies

-- Check user_organizations
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_organizations;
-- Should show your newly created links
```
