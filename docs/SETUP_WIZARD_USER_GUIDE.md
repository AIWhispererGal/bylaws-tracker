## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Connection Refused" or "Cannot Connect to Database"

**What's happening**: Your computer can't reach the database server.

**Solutions to try**:

1. **Check your internet connection**
   - Make sure you're connected to the internet
   - Try opening another website to verify

2. **Verify your Supabase project is running**
   - Log into Supabase dashboard
   - Check that your project status is "Active" (not paused)

3. **Double-check your connection details**
   - Make sure you copied the FULL URL (nothing cut off)
   - Verify there are no extra spaces before or after
   - Confirm you're using the correct password in the database URL

4. **Use WSL IP Address (Windows users only)**
   - If you're running on Windows with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):
   - Find your WSL IP address: Open WSL terminal and type `ip addr show eth0`
   - Look for the `inet` address (e.g., `172.x.x.x`)
   - Instead of `localhost:3000`, use `http://[WSL-IP]:3000`

### Issue: "CSRF Token Invalid" or "CSRF Error"

**What's happening**: Security tokens got mixed up (usually from browser cookies).

**Solution**:

1. Clear your browser cookies for `localhost`
   - **Chrome**: Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Cookies ‚Üí See all cookies ‚Üí Remove `localhost`
   - **Firefox**: Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Cookies ‚Üí Manage Data ‚Üí Remove `localhost`
   - **Edge**: Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Cookies ‚Üí Manage cookies ‚Üí Remove `localhost`

2. Close all browser tabs showing the application

3. Restart the setup wizard (refresh the page)

### Issue: "Port Already in Use" or "Address Already in Use"

**What's happening**: Another program is using port 3000.

**Solution**:

1. **Find and stop the other program**:
   - **Windows**:
     - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` to open Task Manager
     - Look for `node.exe` processes
     - Right-click and select "End Task"

   - **Mac/Linux**:
     - Open Terminal
     - Type: `lsof -i :3000` to find what's using the port
     - Type: `kill -9 [PID]` (replace [PID] with the number shown)

2. **Or use a different port**:
   - Edit the `.env` file
   - Change `PORT=3000` to `PORT=3001`
   - Restart the application

### Issue: "Database Tables Already Exist"

**What's happening**: The database was previously set up.

**Solution**:

If you want to start fresh:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Table Editor
2. Delete all existing tables (if any)
3. Run the setup wizard again

If you want to keep existing data:
1. Skip the "Initialize Database" step
2. Proceed to create your admin account

### Issue: "Admin Account Creation Failed"

**What's happening**: The email might already be registered, or there's a validation error.

**Solutions**:

1. **Try a different email address**
   - The email might already exist in the system

2. **Check password requirements**
   - Must be at least 8 characters
   - Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers

3. **Verify email format**
