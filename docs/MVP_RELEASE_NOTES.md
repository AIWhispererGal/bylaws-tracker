### Feature 2: Customize Your Document Hierarchy ⚙️

- You decide!

**New User Interface:**

```
Document Settings → Configure Hierarchy
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Level 1:  Article (Roman Numerals)      │
│ Level 2:  Section (Numbers)             │
│ Level 3:  Subsection (Lowercase)        │
│ Level 4:  Paragraph (Roman Numerals)    │
