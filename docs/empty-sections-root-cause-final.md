# Root Cause Analysis: Empty Sections in RNC Bylaws Parser

## Executive Summary

**DISCOVERED ROOT CAUSE:** The Table of Contents (TOC) extends beyond the initially detected range. Lines 100-126 are ALSO TOC lines but were not filtered, causing headers without content.

## Problem Statement

- **Current state:** 4 empty sections (was 28 before partial fix)
- **Word retention:** 65.76% (was 84.63%, now WORSE)
- **Goal:** 0 empty sections, 95%+ word retention

## Detailed Analysis

### TOC Detection Issue

The `detectTableOfContents()` function scans lines **0-99** (scanLimit was 100):

```javascript
// Current code (line 82):
const scanLimit = Math.min(100, lines.length);
```

**But the actual TOC extends to line 126!**

Evidence from document:
```
Line 98: Section 1: Administration of Election	20   ← Last detected TOC line
Line 99: (blank)
Line 100: Section 2: Governing Board Structure and Voting	20   ← ALSO TOC! (has TAB + page number)
Line 101: (blank)
Line 102: Section 3: Minimum Voting Age	20   ← ALSO TOC!
...
Line 126: ATTACHMENT B – Governing Board Structure and Voting	24   ← Last TOC line
Line 127: (blank)
Line 128: Reseda Neighborhood Council – 17 Board Seats	24   ← NO TAB, body starts
```

### Pattern Analysis

**TOC Pattern:** `text\tmore_text\tPAGE_NUMBER`
- Uses TAB character to separate columns
- Ends with TAB + digits (page number)
- Regex: `/\t\d+\s*$/`

**Current Detection:**
- Scans lines 0-99
- Finds 35 TOC lines (lines 30-98)
- **MISSES lines 100-126** (27 more TOC lines!)

### Why Word Retention Dropped

**Before TOC filtering (84.63% retention):**
- TOC lines 30-98 detected as orphans
- Attached to Preamble section
- This accidentally captured TOC text
- Result: Higher word count (but wrong - it's duplicate TOC text)

**After TOC filtering (65.76% retention):**
- TOC lines 30-98 correctly filtered
- But lines 100-126 NOT filtered (beyond scan limit)
- These create headers without body content
- Real body content starts at line 128+
- Result: Lower word count (but more accurate - excludes TOC)

### The 4 Remaining Empty Sections

1. **Article X** (line 110) → Actually "ARTICLE XI	GRIEVANCE PROCESS	20" (TOC line!)
2. **Section 10** (line 492) → Content is in the title itself (edge case)
3. **Section 11** (line 496) → Marked "left blank" in source (intentional)
4. **Article VI** (line 502) → Adjacent to Section 11, no content between

Items #1 is a TOC line that should be filtered.
Items #2-4 are legitimate edge cases in the source document.

## Root Cause Summary

**Primary Issue:** TOC scan limit too low (100 lines, should be 200+)

**Secondary Issues:**
1. Some sections legitimately have no content ("left blank")
2. Some sections have content embedded in title
3. Header detection uses character index, not line number (potential mismatch)

## Solution

### Fix #1: Extend TOC Scan Limit ✅ (Already applied)

**File:** `/src/parsers/wordParser.js`
**Line:** 82
**Change:** `const scanLimit = Math.min(200, lines.length);`

**Status:** ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED in latest code

### Fix #2: Filter TOC Items from Hierarchy Detection

**File:** `/src/parsers/wordParser.js`
**Lines:** 142-145
**Current code:**
```javascript
const detectedItems = allDetectedItems.filter(item => {
  const lineNum = this.charIndexToLineNumber(text, item.index);
  return !tocLines.has(lineNum);
});
```

**Status:** ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

### Expected Results After Current Fixes

With scan limit increased to 200:
- TOC lines 100-126 will be detected and filtered
- Empty sections should drop from 4 to ~2 (only legitimate empty sections)
- Word retention should increase to 95%+

### Remaining Edge Cases

After TOC fix, 2-3 sections may still be empty due to source document:

1. **Section 11: "Community Outreach – left blank"**
   - Source document explicitly says "left blank"
   - This is INTENTIONAL, not a parsing error
   - Recommendation: Keep as-is or add placeholder text "(Intentionally left blank)"

2. **Sections with inline content**
   - Some sections have content in the title: "Section 10: Resignation - A Board member may resign..."
   - Recommendation: Extract content from long titles and move to section text

## Testing Plan

Run the test with current fixes:
```bash
npx jest tests/integration/rnc-bylaws-parse.test.js --verbose
```

Expected improvements:
- Empty sections: 4 → 2 (50% reduction)
- Word retention: 65.76% → 95%+ (significant improvement)
- Duplicate citations: 0 (already fixed)

## Files Modified

1. `/src/parsers/wordParser.js` (lines 82, 142-145) ✅
2. Analysis scripts created:
   - `/scripts/analyze-empty-sections.js`
   - `/docs/empty-sections-analysis.md`
   - `/docs/empty-sections-update.md`

## Conclusion

**Root Cause:** TOC scan limit was 100 lines, but TOC actually extends to line 126.

**Solution Applied:** Increased scan limit to 200 lines, added TOC filtering in hierarchy detection.

**Current Status:** Fixes applied, awaiting test confirmation.

**Expected Outcome:**
- ~2 empty sections (legitimate blanks in source)
- 95%+ word retention
- All validation checks pass
