# üîß Section Manipulation Buttons Fix
**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Severity:** HIGH (Owner can't see indent/dedent/split/join buttons)

---

## üêõ BUG REPORT

### Issue
Organization owners cannot see section manipulation buttons (indent, dedent, move up/down, split, join) even though they have owner permissions.

**Symptoms:**
- Buttons visible in code but not rendering for owners
- Global admins might have the same issue
- Only the "Add Suggestion" button shows up

---

## üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### The Problem
The `getUserRole()` function in `src/middleware/permissions.js` was returning the ENTIRE `organization_roles` OBJECT instead of just the `role_code` STRING.

**What Was Returned (WRONG):**
```javascript
{
  role_code: 'owner',
  role_name: 'Owner',
  hierarchy_level: 100
}
```

**What Should Be Returned (CORRECT):**
```javascript
'owner'  // Just the string
```

### Why Buttons Didn't Show

The view template checks:
```ejs
<% if (req.session.isGlobalAdmin || userRole === 'admin' || userRole === 'owner') { %>
  <!-- Show buttons -->
<% } %>
```

When comparing:
```javascript
userRole === 'owner'
// Is actually:
{role_code: 'owner', ...} === 'owner'
// Which is ALWAYS FALSE!
```

**Result:** Buttons never showed even for owners!

---

## ‚úÖ THE FIX

### File Modified
**`src/middleware/permissions.js:161-162`**

### Before (BROKEN):
```javascript
return data?.organization_roles || null;
```

### After (FIXED):
```javascript
// FIX: Return role_code string, not the entire organization_roles object
return data?.organization_roles?.role_code || null;
```

---

## üéØ WHAT THIS FIXES

Now `userRole` will be a STRING:
- `'owner'` for organization owners
- `'admin'` for organization admins
- `'member'` for regular members
- `'viewer'` for read-only users
- `null` for users with no role

The view template comparison will work correctly:
```javascript
userRole === 'owner'  // ‚úÖ TRUE for owners
userRole === 'admin'  // ‚úÖ TRUE for admins
```

## üß™ TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

### Quick Test (2 Minutes)

1. **Restart the server** (REQUIRED - code changed!)
```bash
npm start
```

2. **Login as org owner**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/auth/select
   - Login with owner account
   - Select your organization

3. **Open document viewer**
   - Click on any document
   - Expand a section (click on section card)

4. **Verify buttons appear**
   - Look for "Edit Section:" toolbar
   - Should see these buttons:
     - üîÑ Rename
     - ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Move Up / ‚¨áÔ∏è Move Down
     - ‚û°Ô∏è Indent / ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Dedent
     - ‚úÇÔ∏è Split
     - üîó Join

**Expected Result:**
```
‚úÖ All section manipulation buttons visible
‚úÖ Buttons clickable (not disabled)
‚úÖ Toolbar shows below each section when expanded
```

## üîß WHAT EACH BUTTON DOES

### Rename Button
**Function:** Edit section title and number
**Endpoint:** `/admin/sections/:sectionId/update`

### Move Up/Down Buttons
**Function:** Reorder sections within same parent
**Endpoint:** `/admin/sections/:sectionId/move`

### Indent Button
**Function:** Make section a child of previous sibling
**Endpoint:** `/admin/sections/:sectionId/indent`
**Example:** Turn "3.2" into "3.1.1" (child of 3.1)

### Dedent Button
**Function:** Promote section to parent's level
**Endpoint:** `/admin/sections/:sectionId/dedent`
**Example:** Turn "3.1.1" into "3.2" (sibling of 3.1)

### Split Button
**Function:** Split section text into two sections
**Endpoint:** `/admin/sections/:sectionId/split`
**Note:** Disabled if section has active suggestions

### Join Button
**Function:** Merge adjacent sections together
**Endpoint:** `/admin/sections/join`
**Note:** Disabled if section has active suggestions

## üö® IMPORTANT NOTES

### Server Restart Required
**YOU MUST RESTART THE SERVER** for this fix to take effect!

```bash
# Kill the server (Ctrl+C)
# Then start it again:
npm start
```

### Session Note
If buttons still don't appear after restart:
1. Logout
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. Login again

This ensures your session picks up the new role format.

    <!-- All the buttons -->
  </div>

res.render('dashboard/document-viewer', {
  userRole: req.userRole || req.session.userRole || 'viewer',
  // ... other data
});
```

### Where req.userRole Is Populated

## üêù DEBUGGING TIPS

### If Buttons Still Don't Show

1. **Check Browser Console (F12)**
```javascript
// Look for these in console logs:
// Should see: 'üë§ [DOCUMENT VIEWER] User permissions: ...'
```

2. **Check userRole Value**
Open browser console and type:
```javascript
console.log(document.body.innerHTML.match(/userRole:.*?<\/script>/))
```
Should show `userRole: 'owner'` not `userRole: [object Object]`

3. **Check Database Role**
```sql
SELECT uo.*, r.role_code, r.role_name
FROM user_organizations uo
JOIN organization_roles r ON uo.role_id = r.id
WHERE uo.user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
  AND uo.organization_id = 'YOUR_ORG_ID';
```

Should return `role_code = 'owner'` for your user.
