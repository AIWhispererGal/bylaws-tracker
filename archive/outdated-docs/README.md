# Outdated Documentation Archive

This directory contains documentation files that have been superseded by newer versions or are no longer relevant to the current project state.

## Archived Files

Files archived here include:
- Implementation guides that have been replaced
- Setup guides superseded by newer documentation
- Deployment guides for deprecated deployment methods
- Configuration guides for old system configurations
- Migration guides for completed migrations
- Status reports and completion notices

## Why These Were Archived

- **Superseded by active documentation** - Newer, more comprehensive docs exist in `/docs`
- **Historical reference only** - No longer applicable to current project state
- **Completed migrations** - Migration guides for already-completed work
- **Root clutter reduction** - Moving reference docs to organized location
