## 📊 Detailed Feature Assessment

### ✅ COMPLETED FEATURES

#### 1. 10-Level Document Parsing (P5)

**Status:** ✅ **VERIFIED COMPLETE - NO CODE CHANGES REQUIRED**

**Finding:** The system ALREADY supports 10 levels of document parsing (depth 0-9):
- ✅ Database schema: `CHECK(depth >= 0 AND depth <= 10)`
- ✅ Default configuration: 10 levels defined in `organizationConfig.js`
- ✅ Schema validation: Supports maxDepth up to 20
- ✅ Parsers: No hardcoded depth limitations
- ✅ UI: Renders sections dynamically based on configuration

**Documentation:**
- `/docs/reports/P5_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive verification
- `/docs/reports/P5_SUBSECTION_DEPTH_REPORT.md` - Detailed analysis
- `/tests/integration/deep-hierarchy.test.js` - Test coverage
- `/scripts/verify-depth-support.js` - Verification script

**Conclusion:** This was NEVER a technical limitation, only a UX/documentation issue. The setup wizard preview only showed 2 levels, causing confusion. **NO implementation needed.**

#### 2. P6: Section Editor Tools for Parsing Correction

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - READY FOR TESTING**

**Implemented Operations (8/8):**
1. ✅ **Rename** - Edit section title and number
2. ✅ **Delete** - Remove section with cascade options
3. ✅ **Move Up/Down** - Reorder within siblings
4. ✅ **Indent** - Make child of previous sibling
5. ✅ **Dedent** - Move to parent's level
6. ✅ **Split** - Split section into two parts
7. ✅ **Join** - Merge adjacent sections together
8. ✅ **Get Tree** - Fetch hierarchical section structure

**Implementation Complete:**
- ✅ 6 API routes in `/src/routes/admin.js` (~800 lines)
- ✅ 8 button operations in `/views/dashboard/document-viewer.ejs` (~850 lines)
- ✅ 4 modal dialogs (Retitle, Delete, Split, Join)
- ✅ 6 database helper functions
- ✅ 3 validation middleware functions
- ✅ Permission checks (admin-only)
- ✅ Visual feedback (toasts)

**Database:**
- Migration 020: `020_section_editing_functions.sql` (312 lines)
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Migration 020 must be applied before testing

**Documentation:**
- `/docs/P6_SECTION_EDITOR_COMPLETE.md` - Complete implementation summary
- `/docs/P6_SECTION_EDITOR_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - Status report
- `/docs/P6_SECTION_EDITOR_UI_COMPLETE.md` - UI implementation

**Next Step:** Apply migration 020 to database, then test all 8 operations.

### ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

#### Database Migrations

**Status:** ⚠️ 2 of 3 migration files exist, but **NONE are applied yet**

| Migration | File Status | Database Status | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| 018 | ✅ Created | ❌ Not Applied | Per-document hierarchy override |
| 019 | ✅ Created | ❌ Not Applied | Suggestion rejection tracking |
| 020 | ✅ Created | ❌ Not Applied | Section editing functions |

**Critical Action Required:**
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor (dev environment):
-- 1. Run migration 018 (hierarchy override column)
-- 2. Run migration 019 (rejection tracking columns)
-- 3. Run migration 020 (section editing functions)
```

**Files Located At:**
- `database/migrations/018_add_per_document_hierarchy.sql`
- `database/migrations/019_add_suggestion_rejection_tracking.sql`
- `database/migrations/020_section_editing_functions.sql`

## 📝 NEW REQUIREMENTS FROM USER

Based on the user's request, two requirements need clarification or enhancement:

### New Requirement 1: Enhanced Suggestion Rejection Visibility

**User Request:**
> "When a suggestion is marked rejected, the rejected suggestions should be hidden or not loaded by default and not available as an option to lockin/approve."

**Current Status:** ✅ **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**

The existing implementation (Feature 2) ALREADY meets this requirement:
- ✅ Rejected suggestions **NOT loaded by default**
- ✅ "Show Rejected" toggle button loads them on-demand
- ✅ Rejected suggestions cannot be locked/approved (no radio button)
- ✅ Query parameter `?includeRejected=true` for API

**No additional work needed** for this requirement.

---

### New Requirement 2: Section Auto-Reload After Lock

**User Request:**
> "When a suggestion has been locked in, that section should reload so that it displays correctly for the person who locked it without requiring a page reload."

**Current Status:** ✅ **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**

The existing implementation (Feature 3) ALREADY meets this requirement:
- ✅ `refreshSectionAfterLock()` function implemented
- ✅ Section refreshes automatically after lock
- ✅ No page reload required
- ✅ All UI elements update (badges, content, buttons, suggestions)
- ✅ Only user who locked sees immediate update

**No additional work needed** for this requirement.

---

## 🔍 CLARIFICATIONS NEEDED FROM USER

### Question 1: Hierarchy Schema Customization Timing

The current implementation allows admins to customize the 10-level hierarchy **per document** AFTER upload via a dedicated hierarchy editor UI. The user mentioned:

> "Just a small addendum after initial document upload we should allow global admin org owner/ admin to designate which type of lettering/numbering for each level."

**Clarification Needed:**
- ✅ Is the current implementation (hierarchy editor accessible from document detail page) acceptable?
- ✅ OR do you want this as part of the upload workflow itself?

**Current Implementation:**
- Admin uploads document → Document parsed with org default hierarchy
- Admin clicks "Configure Hierarchy" button on document page
- Hierarchy editor opens (modal or page)
- Admin selects template or customizes 10 levels
- Saves → Document now uses custom hierarchy for future operations

**Alternative (if desired):**
- Admin uploads document
- BEFORE parsing, show hierarchy configuration step
- Admin selects template or customizes
- Document parsed with selected hierarchy immediately

**Please confirm:** Is current implementation acceptable, or do you prefer the alternative?

---

### Question 2: Section Editor (P6) - Is This the "Parsing Correction" Feature?

The user mentioned:
> "Enabling Global admin, org admin/owners to correct parsing (we had a detailed plan about that)."

**Clarification Needed:**
The **P6 Section Editor** provides 8 operations to correct parsing errors:
- Rename (fix section titles/numbers)
- Delete (remove incorrect sections)
- Move (reorder sections)
- Indent/Dedent (fix hierarchy levels)
- Split (divide oversized sections)
- Join (merge fragmented sections)

**Is this the "parsing correction" feature you referred to?**
- ✅ YES → P6 is complete, just needs migration 020 applied
- ❌ NO → Please describe what "parsing correction" means to you

---
