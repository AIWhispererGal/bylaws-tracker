# ✅ Login Access Fix - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Status:** **READY TO TEST** ✅

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

**Your Issue:**
> "Goes right to dashboard. Can't login. Could you PLEASE have the first page not query or be fancy or anything just offer up login or create new user."

**The Problem:**
The root route (`/`) was trying to be "smart" by checking if you had a session and organization, then automatically redirecting to the dashboard. This prevented you from accessing the login page.

**The Fix:**
Simplified `server.js` lines 379-392 to be dead simple:
1. Check if setup is complete
2. If not → go to `/setup`
3. If yes → **ALWAYS** go to `/auth/login`

No queries, no fancy logic, no automatic redirects to dashboard.

## ✅ What Happens Now

**When you visit http://localhost:3000:**

```
1. You'll be redirected to → http://localhost:3000/auth/login
2. You'll see the login page with:
   - Login form (for existing users)
   - Register link (for new users)
   - No automatic dashboard redirects
   - No complex logic
```

```
