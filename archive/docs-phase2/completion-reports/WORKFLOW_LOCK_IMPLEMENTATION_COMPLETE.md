# Workflow Lock Implementation - Complete

**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Ready for Testing

---

## üéØ Overview

Complete implementation of the workflow locking system that allows users to:
1. **SELECT** a suggestion or "Keep Original Text"
2. **LOCK** the selected text as the current version
3. **APPROVE** to advance the section to the next workflow stage

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Database Schema (Migration 017)

**File:** `database/migrations/017_add_document_sections_lock_columns.sql`

**Columns Added to `document_sections`:**
- `is_locked` (BOOLEAN, default FALSE) - Whether section is locked
- `locked_at` (TIMESTAMP) - When section was locked
- `locked_by` (UUID, FK to auth.users) - Who locked the section
- `selected_suggestion_id` (UUID, FK to suggestions) - Which suggestion was locked
- `locked_text` (TEXT) - The text that was locked (snapshot)

**Indexes Created:**
- `idx_document_sections_is_locked` - Find locked sections quickly
- `idx_document_sections_locked_by` - Find sections locked by user
- `idx_document_sections_selected_suggestion` - Find sections with selected suggestions

**To Apply:** Run the SQL file in your Supabase SQL editor

---

### 2. Backend API Updates

#### Lock Endpoint: `/api/workflow/sections/:sectionId/lock`

**File:** `src/routes/workflow.js` (lines 1630-1757)

**What It Does:**
1. Validates user has permission to lock at current workflow stage
2. Fetches current section text (current_text or original_text)
3. If suggestion selected: fetches suggestion text
4. If "Keep Original" selected: uses current text
5. Updates `document_sections`:
   - Sets `is_locked = true`
   - Sets `locked_at` timestamp
   - Sets `locked_by` to user ID
   - Sets `selected_suggestion_id` (if suggestion selected)
   - Sets `locked_text` to the selected text
   - **Updates `current_text` to the locked text** (makes it current)
6. Updates workflow state metadata with lock information
7. Returns success with section data

**Key Features:**
- Prevents locking if stage doesn't allow it (`stage.can_lock = false`)
- Prevents locking if user lacks permissions
- Prevents re-locking already locked sections
- Updates both `locked_text` and `current_text` to ensure consistency

#### State Endpoint: `/api/workflow/sections/:sectionId/state`

**File:** `src/routes/workflow.js` (lines 1256-1330)

**What It Does:**
1. Fetches workflow state for section
2. **NEW:** Fetches section lock information from `document_sections`
3. Returns comprehensive state including:
   - Workflow status (pending/approved/rejected)
   - Current workflow stage
   - User permissions (canApprove, canReject, canLock, canEdit)
   - **Section lock status** (is_locked, locked_at, locked_by, locked_text)

**Key Updates:**
- Added section lock data to API response
- Disabled locking if section already locked (`canLock = false` when `is_locked = true`)
- Disabled editing if section locked (`canEdit = false` when `is_locked = true`)

---

### 3. Frontend UI Updates

#### Document Viewer Template

**File:** `views/dashboard/document-viewer.ejs`

**Visual Indicators Added:**

1. **Unexpanded Section View** (lines 248-257):
   - Shows blue "Locked" badge if `is_locked = true`
   - Shows green "Amended" badge if `locked_text` differs from `original_text`
   - Displays `locked_text` as preview text (instead of current_text)

2. **Expanded Section View** (lines 288-320):
   - Shows alert box with lock status
   - If locked with changes: Shows "Show Changes" button
   - If locked without changes: Shows "Original text locked" message
   - Displays `locked_text` as the full section text
   - Hidden diff view container for change tracking

3. **Suggestion Selection** (lines 622-648):
   - "Keep Original Text" radio button option
   - Radio buttons on each suggestion
   - Lock button enables when suggestion selected
   - Lock button disabled until selection made

**JavaScript Functions Added:**

1. **`showDiffView(sectionId)`** (lines 867-918):
   - Fetches original and locked text
   - Generates HTML diff with red strikethrough (deletions) and green highlighting (additions)
   - Toggles between normal view and diff view
   - Updates button text between "Show Changes" and "Hide Changes"

2. **`updateSectionWorkflowBadge(sectionId, workflowData)`** (lines 957-1010):
   - **Updated** to show lock status in workflow badge
   - Displays lock icon (üîí) when section is locked
   - Shows "Locked" status instead of "Pending" when locked
   - Uses blue badge color for locked sections

3. **`lockSelectedSuggestion(sectionId)`** (lines 752-789):
   - Validates suggestion is selected
   - Sends POST to `/api/workflow/sections/:sectionId/lock`
   - Passes `suggestionId: 'original'` for "Keep Original Text"
   - Passes `suggestionId: <uuid>` for selected suggestion
   - Shows toast notification on success/failure
   - Reloads section state and suggestions after locking
   - Updates workflow progress bar

4. **`updateLockButton(sectionId, suggestionId)`** (lines 743-749):
   - Tracks which suggestion is selected via Map
   - Reloads workflow state to update button visibility
   - Enables/disables lock button based on selection

---

### 4. Dashboard Route Updates

**File:** `src/routes/dashboard.js` (lines 818-833)

**What Changed:**
- Added comment documenting that lock columns are included in query
- Sections now include `is_locked`, `locked_at`, `locked_by`, `locked_text`, `selected_suggestion_id`
- Data is passed to EJS template for rendering

## üîÑ User Workflow

### Complete Flow: SELECT ‚Üí LOCK ‚Üí APPROVE

```
1. USER opens document viewer
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Sections load with workflow status badges

2. USER expands a section
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Suggestions load (if any exist)
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Workflow action buttons appear (Approve/Reject/Lock)

3. USER selects a suggestion OR "Keep Original Text"
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Radio button selected
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Lock button ENABLES (changes from gray to blue)

4. USER clicks "Lock Selected Suggestion"
   ‚îî‚îÄ> POST to /api/workflow/sections/:sectionId/lock
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Database updates:
       - is_locked = TRUE
       - locked_at = NOW()
       - locked_by = USER_ID
       - locked_text = selected text
       - current_text = locked_text (NOW CURRENT!)
       - selected_suggestion_id = suggestion UUID (or NULL)
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Success toast appears
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Section badge shows "Locked" with üîí icon
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Section header shows blue "Locked" badge
   ‚îî‚îÄ> If amended: Shows green "Amended" badge + "Show Changes" button

5. USER can now:
   ‚îú‚îÄ> Click "Show Changes" to see diff view (red deletions, green additions)
   ‚îú‚îÄ> Click "Approve" to advance section to next workflow stage
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Move to next section and repeat
```

## üìä Visual Design

### Badge Colors

- **Blue "Locked"** - Section is locked and cannot be edited
- **Green "Amended"** - Locked text differs from original (changes made)
- **Yellow "Pending"** - Workflow status is pending approval
- **Green "Approved"** - Workflow status is approved
- **Red "Rejected"** - Workflow status is rejected

### Icons

- üîí (lock-fill) - Section is locked
- ‚úèÔ∏è (pencil-square) - Section has amendments
- ‚úÖ (check-circle) - Section approved
- ‚ùå (x-circle) - Section rejected
- üïê (clock-history) - Section pending

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **No Unlock Feature** - Once locked, sections cannot be unlocked
   - *Workaround:* Admin would need to manually update database
   - *Future:* Add unlock button for admins

2. **No Lock History** - Lock actions are recorded in workflow metadata but not displayed
   - *Future:* Show lock history in approval history modal

3. **No Lock Notifications** - Other users aren't notified when sections are locked
   - *Future:* Real-time notifications via WebSocket

### Edge Cases Handled

‚úÖ **Multi-org membership** - Filters by `organizationId` to prevent permission conflicts
‚úÖ **No workflow assigned** - Returns default pending state
‚úÖ **Missing suggestion** - Falls back to current/original text when locking
‚úÖ **Already locked** - Prevents re-locking and disables lock button
‚úÖ **Insufficient permissions** - Returns 403 with clear error message
