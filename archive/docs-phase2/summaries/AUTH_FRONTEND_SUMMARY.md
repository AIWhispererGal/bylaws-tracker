## UI Design Patterns

### Color Scheme
- Primary gradient: `#667eea` → `#764ba2` (purple gradient)
- Success: `#10b981` (green)
- Danger: `#ef4444` (red)
- Info: `#3b82f6` (blue)
- Warning: `#f59e0b` (orange)

### Typography
- Font: System fonts (Apple/Segoe UI/Roboto)
- Headers: Bold, gradient text
- Body: Regular weight, clear hierarchy

### Components
- **Cards:** White background, rounded corners (12px), subtle shadows
- **Forms:** Clean inputs with icon prefixes, focus states
- **Buttons:** Gradient backgrounds, hover effects, loading spinners
- **Badges:** Pill-shaped, color-coded by type
- **Modals:** Centered, clean layout, clear actions

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints at 768px and 576px
- Stacked layouts on mobile
- Touch-friendly buttons (min 44x44px)

## Accessibility Features

1. **ARIA Labels:**
   - Form fields have `aria-required="true"`
   - Error messages use `aria-live="polite"`
   - Buttons have descriptive `aria-label`

2. **Keyboard Navigation:**
   - All interactive elements focusable
   - Tab order follows visual order
   - Focus indicators visible (`outline: 2px solid #667eea`)

3. **Screen Reader Support:**
   - Semantic HTML (form, nav, main)
   - Error announcements via live regions
   - Icon alternatives with text

4. **Visual Accessibility:**
   - High contrast text (WCAG AA compliant)
   - Clear focus states
   - Loading states with text, not just spinners

## Integration Requirements

### Backend Routes Needed:
```javascript
// Authentication
GET  /auth/login
POST /auth/login
GET  /auth/register
POST /auth/register
GET  /auth/logout
GET  /auth/forgot-password
GET  /auth/profile
GET  /auth/select-organization

// User Management (Admin only)
GET    /admin/users
POST   /admin/users/invite
PUT    /admin/users/:id/role
DELETE /admin/users/:id
```

### Session Data Required:
```javascript
{
  currentUser: {
    id: string,
    email: string,
    full_name: string,
    role: 'admin' | 'editor' | 'viewer',
    status: 'active' | 'pending'
  },
  organizationId: string,
  organizationName: string
}
```

### Database Schema Needed:
- `users` table with email, password_hash, full_name
- `user_organizations` table with user_id, organization_id, role
- `invitations` table for pending user invites

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login form validates email format
- [ ] Login form requires password
- [ ] Login shows loading state on submit
- [ ] Register form validates all fields
- [ ] Register shows password strength
- [ ] Register confirms password match
- [ ] User list displays correctly
- [ ] Admin can invite users
- [ ] Admin can change roles
- [ ] Admin can remove users
- [ ] Non-admins cannot access user management
- [ ] User dropdown shows in dashboard
- [ ] Logout button works
- [ ] All forms are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Screen readers announce errors
- [ ] Mobile layout works correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Developer:** Implement authentication routes and middleware
2. **Database Engineer:** Create user tables and RLS policies
3. **Security Engineer:** Implement password hashing and JWT tokens
4. **Email Service:** Set up invitation and verification emails
5. **Testing:** Create integration tests for auth flow

## Notes

- UI matches existing dashboard design system
- All forms use Bootstrap 5 for consistency
- Client-side validation provides immediate feedback
- Server-side validation still required for security
- Password requirements can be adjusted in `auth.js`
- User limit (50) can be configured per organization tier
