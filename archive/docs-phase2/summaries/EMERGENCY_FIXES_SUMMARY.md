## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Fixed 404 Error: `/admin/organization` Route Missing

**Problem:** Admin users got 404 error when clicking "Organization Settings"

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Added new route at `/src/routes/admin.js` line 139
- ✅ Created view file `/views/admin/organization-settings.ejs`
- ✅ Route now displays all organizations with quick access links

**Test:** Navigate to `/admin/organization` → should load without errors

---

### 2. Fixed Critical Bug: Suggestions Showing for ALL Sections

**Problem:** When viewing a section, ALL suggestions from ALL sections were displayed instead of just that section's suggestions.

**Root Cause:** Duplicate route definitions in `/src/routes/dashboard.js`
- First route (line 310) ignored `section_id` parameter
- Second route (line 563) correctly filtered but was never reached
- Express matches routes in order, so first route always won

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Consolidated into single intelligent route (line 312)
- ✅ Route checks if `section_id` parameter exists
- ✅ If `section_id` provided: returns only that section's suggestions
- ✅ If no `section_id`: returns all pending suggestions for organization
- ✅ Removed duplicate route

**Test:** Expand a section → should show ONLY suggestions for that specific section

## 🔍 Technical Details

### How the Fix Works

**Before (BROKEN):**
```javascript
// TWO routes with same path - Express uses first one
router.get('/suggestions', ...) // Ignores section_id ❌
router.get('/suggestions', ...) // Filters by section_id ✅ (never reached)
```

**After (FIXED):**
```javascript
// ONE intelligent route
router.get('/suggestions', (req, res) => {
  const { section_id } = req.query;

  if (section_id) {
    // Filter by section via junction table ✅
    return suggestions for THIS section only;
  } else {
    // Return all pending suggestions ✅
    return all suggestions for organization;
  }
});
```
