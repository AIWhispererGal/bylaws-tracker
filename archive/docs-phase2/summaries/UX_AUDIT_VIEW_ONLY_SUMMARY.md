# View-Only UX Audit - Executive Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Overall Grade:** 🟡 **C-** (Needs Improvement)
**Status:** 🔴 **Action Required**

---

## TL;DR - Critical Issues

1. ❌ **No onboarding for view-only users** - They don't know what they can/can't do
2. ❌ **Confusing disabled buttons** - Actions appear available but fail
3. ❌ **No upgrade request path** - Users told to "contact admin" with no mechanism
4. ❌ **Tasks shown that can't be completed** - "Approve" tasks shown to viewers
5. ✅ **Backend security is solid** - Permission enforcement works correctly

---

## Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)

### 1. Add Onboarding Modal (2-3 hours)
```javascript
// Show on first viewer login
Modal: "Welcome! You have view-only access"
- Lists what viewers CAN do
- Lists what they CANNOT do
- Links to upgrade request
```

### 2. Hide Inaccessible Buttons (3-4 hours)
```ejs
<!-- Instead of disabled buttons, hide them -->
<% if (userPermissions.canSuggest) { %>
  <button>Add Suggestion</button>
<% } else { %>
  <div class="text-muted">View-only - <a href="#">Request access</a></div>
<% } %>
```

### 3. Filter Tasks by Role (1-2 hours)
```javascript
// Don't show "Approve" tasks to viewers
if (userRole !== 'viewer') {
  myTasks.push({ type: 'Approval', ... });
} else {
  myTasks.push({ type: 'Review', ... });
}
```

## What Viewers SHOULD Be Able To Do

✅ **Currently Working:**
- View all documents
- Read all sections
- See suggestions (read-only)
- View workflow status
- View approval history

⚠️ **Unnecessarily Restricted:**
- 📄 Export documents (should allow - it's read-only!)
- 🖨️ Print documents (should add print CSS)
- 🔗 Share read-only links (should implement)

❌ **Correctly Restricted:**
- Create/edit suggestions
- Approve/reject workflow
- Invite users
- Modify settings
